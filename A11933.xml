            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The text of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being ſuch, as of it ſelfe deſerueth all reuerence: the Commentarie ſo framed, as a taſte of it being taken, it will eaſily procure a good appetite to embrace the whole throughly. But that ſuch as be deſirous of heauenly wiſedome, and yet haue not attained to ſuch ripeneſſe of iudgement, as they can of themſelues diſcerne of bookes (that in theſe dayes are ſet forth in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) which are moſt for their profit, may bee put in minde of the excellencie of this treatiſe to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their godly ſtudie, I thought good, beeing thereto required, in fewe wordes to encourage them to vndertake the reading thereof to the ende they maye reape ſuch profite thereby, as may delight them for the preſent, and the frute thereof remaine with them for euer. The wiſedome of God, in all the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inſpired of God, ſheweth it ſelfe, according to the matter whereof it entreateth, to be moſt excellent. The argument of this ſermon being of wiſedome, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that inſtrument of the holie Ghoſt, whome God choſe aboue all men (except him in whome all the treaſures of wiſedome are layd vp, our Sauiour Chriſt I meane) in whome hee would place the excellencie of vnderſtanding, about the attaining whereof all the
<pb facs="tcp:17735:4"/> wiſe men of the worlde dulled their wittes in vaine: there muſt needes be opened vnto vs thereby a certain and vndoubted way vnto the holy cloſet of true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and heauenly wiſedome. <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelfe the Preacher, a right figure of our Sauiour Chriſt, both in his peaceable and glorious kingdome, and in his excellent and ſupereminent wiſedome, was a man ſo prepared of God, to be a moſte notable ſtorehouſe of Sapience, as no meane of comming thereby in him was wanting. For firſt by naturall towardneſſe, good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſtudie, and other ordinarie meanes, he attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuch extraordinarie knowledge, as euen in his tender yeares, which age is moſt ſubiect to folly, hee obtained the name and credite of a wiſe man before he was a growen man, which not one among tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand euen in his gray heares deſerueth to carie. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſpecial grace &amp; diuine reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he was aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And laſt of al, before the endighting of this diuine preaching, he had the principal of al his former knowledge, &amp; matter of this ſermon confirmed by experience, which among men is counted to haue ſo great moment to the obteining of wiſedom, as no man lightly is counted wiſe, which vnto knowledge &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning hath not ioyned practiſe &amp; experience. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſame <hi>Solomon,</hi> by the ſecrete &amp; yet moſt wiſe iudgement of God, was ſuffered for al his wiſdom to fal into ſuch folly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which many thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable to him in knowledge, are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by grace, to ſhewe a moſt cleare distinction betwene

Some others doe in ſuche ſorte weigh the circumſtances of his moſt greeuous ſinne, that they make a very great doubt of his ſaluation. For the Scripture doth flatly ſet downe, that the heart of Solomon went aſide from the God of Iſraell, and that by foule abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the goodneſſe of God towards him, as vnto whome God had appeared twiſe. Moreouer that this fell oute vnto him at the laſt ende almoſt of his life, after ſo manye and ſo great tokens of God his mercye and liberalitie towardes him, in that age, wherein if euer, he ought in deede to haue had bene wiſe. That it was alſo a ſhamefull kinde of fault a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt true religion, the which in the faythfull (howſoeuer they are ſometimes diuerſlye carried awaye of their owne luſtes) doth take ſuch deepe roote, that it cannot chuſe at al times, but bring forth moſt plentiful fruit of reuerence and conſtancy. To conclude, that there appeareth no teſtimonye of his repentance, and that the renting aſunder of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which within ſhort time followed, doeth teache that God did in no wiſe forgiue vnto him this fault.</p>

               <note place="margin">The minde of the Author touching the ſaluation of Solomon.</note>Doubtleſſe the fault of <hi>Solomon</hi> was moſt greeuous, and cannot by any meanes be excuſed. For that hee whiche had receiued ſuche ſinguler giftes of GOD aboute the laſte tyme of his lyfe, did of wicked raſhneſſe fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye vnto Superſtition, and to the offence of the church and deſtruction of manye, did ſette vp publike Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and tokens of that his fallinge awaye, it is a thing ſo ſhamefull, as is that whiche is moſte ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Yet are not theſe thinges to this ende ſet downe vnto vs, that we ſhoulde take vpon vs ſo muche authoritie ouer the ſecret iudgementes of God, that wee ſhoulde conclude ſo ſingular a perſon whome the Lorde woulde haue to be a Figure of his Chriſte, to bee appoynted vnto euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction, wherefore as it is a pointe of raſhneſſe certaynely to pronounce of ſo weightye a matter: ſo on
<pb facs="tcp:17735:6"/> the contrarye parte, it is a token of ſafeneſſe and modeſtye, in matters of ſuche importaunce, and nothing at all apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning vnto our knowledge, by ſtaying oure iudgement to be wiſe out of the worde of God, and there out only to gather thoſe thinges whiche hee will haue of vs to bee knowne.</p>
            <p>The fall then of ſo excellente a perſonage,<note place="margin">To what ende the fal of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon is ſet forth vnto vs</note> is therefore ſet forth vnto vs, that we ſhould knowe with howe great care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe we ought to walke betweene the ſleightes of the Deuill and ſinne, in whoſe ſnares the beſt men are ſomtimes entrapped: and moreouer that we holilye vſe the giftes of God, leaſt being puffed vp with them, we bee depriued of his grace, of the which being voyde, and truſting vnto our ſtrength, we muſt needes runne headlong into aſſured de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Further the expreſſe and plaine ſetting downe of the faulte of Solomon, appertayneth vnto the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye following of the ſcattering of the kingdome of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, the cauſe whereof to haue reſted in the poſterity of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> is playnely proued by this notable ſinne of Solomon. But for all this, whatſoeuer may bee determined eyther of the ſaluation or damnation of Solomon,<note place="margin">The fal of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon is no diſcredit to his writings, And why?</note> this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding muſt be holden for certaintye, that the reproche of his falling awaye or puniſhment, maketh nothing at all agaynſte his Writinges, and that therefore the authority of them is not hereby leſſened nor diminiſhed: For as muche as Solomon is not the Author, but onlye the Writer and interpreter of the truth in them conteyned and taughte, for the authoritie of doctrine muſt not hang vpon the perſon of the miniſter, but altogether vpon the dignitye of the Author. And there is nothing, eyther in this or in the reſt of the writinges of Solomon, the which doeth not very well agree with the truth of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the which is all one and ſimple truth: as with one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured conſent, the learned and right minded antiquity hath acknowledged: and the Hebrew copie it ſelfe numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the holye writinges doeth ſufficiently declare.</p>
            <p>Therefore I will not make anye longer ſtaye in the proofe of that matter, the whiche I ſet downe as ſure, and agreede vppon: namelye, that the writinges of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and alſo this Sermon, are Canonicall Scripture,
<pb facs="tcp:17735:7"/> and plainely agree with the truth, and that God would haue them remaine abroade for the edifying of his Ghurch. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye we are to begge of him that we may learn the pure and true meaning of this Sermon, and applye it vnto oure profite.</p>

               <note place="margin">The cheefe and or ſcope of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note>Hauing layde downe the authoritie of this Booke, the nexte is, that we ſee what is his ſcope, that is, his cheefe end, and what is the matter whereof it entreateth. They whiche haue in ſuche ſorte marked out this end, that they ſaye, that <hi>Solomon</hi> in ſetting forth the vanitie of this lyfe (that is to ſay of the councels and doinges of men) minded to make vs contented, and to be of quiet mindes in the common affairs and chaunces of this life, that we ſhould vſe with thanks gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the creatures of God, which through his bleſſing are frankely giuen vnto vs, being contented with thinges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, without carefull penſiueneſſe for thinges to come: doe in deede ſay ſomething, but yet doe not plainely ynough ſet downe the matter: like as they doe not alſo who do thinke the principal point of this worke thus to be diuided: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that this whole ſermon is an auouching of doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God his prouidence, and a confuting of ſuch things as may be obiected againſt it, in the whiche are comfortes to ſtrengthen our mindes againſt the confuſion of thinges, and threatninges againſt thoſe vnbrideled outrages of men of lewd diſpoſition, which in this life run raſhlye on on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head without all feare as it were of puniſhment. For theſe places are very excellently handled in this diſcourſe, yet are they not to be iudged the cheefe and principall ende of the ſame, but they are fitly applied for the proofe thereof. Now the rules of a true demonſtration doe require, that the thing it ſelfe be ſeuered from the circumſtances of the ſame. And as the thing or matter is one, ſo ought it to be noted oute with one certaine name, and not to be darkelye ſhadowed with a long diſcourſe of many words, leaſt that it bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the circumſtaunces of the ſame, the whiche were altogether diſagreeing from good order of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</p>
            <p>Therefore I take the principall ende of this diſcourſe to be, OF THE CHEEFE, or, SOVEREIGNE GOOD, the whiche by his contrary is notably declared.
<pb facs="tcp:17735:7"/> For when as Felicitie or happineſſe is the principall and cheefe ende of oure whole life, and that all men with the whole labour and endeuour of their willes and ſtudies are caried therevnto, and becauſe in that common conſent and deſire of one and the ſame thing, there are ſo many and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers opinions of men of all ſortes, and yet in the mean ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the greateſt part of men are led far and wide away from <hi>Felicitie or happineſſe,</hi> it is altogether needefull that there ſhould be extant a plaine doctrine of Felicitie, wherevppon we might certainely reſt: leaſt in ſtead of true happineſſe, we laye holde vpon the ſhew and ſhadow of happineſſe. The which doubtleſſe will come to paſſe, if we follow the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and leading of the wit of man, which with pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiue, raſh, and wandring error, ſeeketh felicitie in things of this world The which penſiueneſſe and errour of men, <hi>Solomon</hi> doeth here ſo artificially deſcribe and paint out, being a fit iudge of this controuerſie, that the heate and earneſtneſſe of thoſe reaſoninges, and debating the matter cannot more liuelye be layd before vs. For firſt he teacheth that happineſſe is no where to be found in things of the world, <hi>viz.</hi> hee ſheweth, <hi>What happines is not,</hi> againſt the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of man his reaſon, dreaming falſly of a vaine ſhew of happineſſe. Then hauing confuted the errours of this corrupte reaſon, hee teacheth <hi>What felicitie or happineſſe is,</hi> and as he had parted and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it from all the counſailes and dealinges of the life of man: ſo hee doeth altogether place it in the feare of God, that is to ſay, in the true knowledge of the true God, and in his diligent and earneſt ſeruice: and finally he doeth diuerſlye and ſingulerlye declare the vſe of this knowledge. That this is the true ende, and handling of this whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the thinges being diligently weighed, I hope that all learned and ſober minded men will confeſſe with mee, and that the ſame may fitly be diuided into three pointes. For firſt the contrary member of this principall queſtion is ſet downe by the waye of confutation, namely, that <hi>true felicity is neuer to be found in any worldly matter, yea and that the title of happineſſe is falſly giuen vnto them,</hi> for as muche as in them there is no ſufficiencie or fulneſſe, ſo that the minde maye be content with his owne eſtate, but moſt great want of all thinges. Secondlye, the eſpeciall matter of this diſcourſe is
<pb facs="tcp:17735:8"/> ſhewed, and that expreſly, <hi>What true felicity or happines is,</hi> the which is wholy placed in godlines. And he teacheth that the ſame is not a vain &amp; idle contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but indeed a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful &amp; effectual, the which goeth far &amp; wide, through the life of ours. Thirdly the vſe of this moſt notable doctrine, is at large ſet forth, &amp; in diſcourſing thereof, throughout all the parts of man his life, a great part of this treatiſe is occupied. For he diligently teacheth &amp; noteth a double force, &amp; as it were reaſon of this vſe. Firſt that we ſhould ſtrengthen our minds with conuenient remedies againſt the want &amp; vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of fleeting and brittle things, that is, of ſuch things as are to be found in this mortall and miſerable life, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we ſhould turne our ſelues from the vncertayne and cumberſome ſtate of the ſame, vnto thinges heauenly and euerlaſting, and vnto that hope of reſtoring: and in the meane ſeaſon aſſure our ſelues that the prouidence of God will watche ouer our affayres, that truſting vnto his ayde, hauing our mindes pacifyed, wee ſhould beare the toyles and laboures of this lyfe, and being contented with the preſent ſtate of thinges, we ſhould vſe and enioye the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, and abandoning the deſyres of vayn thinges, wherevnto worldly men in vaine doe giue themſelues, wee ſhoulde ſeeke ſound ſufficiency and fulneſſe of mind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the loue of this world, and among all the garboyles of the life of man, looke for vnto our ſelues an happy end. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that we ſhould earneſtly thinke vpon the leading of our life godly and honeſtly: the which is the way vnto hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and the ſecond effect of this vſe.</p>
            <p>All theſe thinges are plentifully and notably diſcourſed by Solomon, with a certaine and conſtant rowe of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the Obiections which ſeeme to be agaynſt this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine are diligentlye rehearſed, becauſe theſe prophane and worldly cogitations and thoughts do ſtir vp great &amp; dayly turmoiles in the mindes of men. Againſt theſe alſo are ſet down conuenient and fit remedies, to eaſe our myndes of the abaſhmente of theſe confuſions and garboyles whiche doe compaſſe and beſet this life of ours: there are adioined many promiſes to comfort the heartes of the faythfull, and threatnings againſt the authors and workers of thoſe ſturs, and that for the ſake of the godlye, leaſt that they ſhould be
<pb facs="tcp:17735:8"/> too much diſmayde at the outwarde felicitie of deſperate and lewde perſons, therefore as the ſtate of this diſcourſe is moſt ſimple and one, namely <hi>concerning felicitie or happineſſe,</hi> ſo there are vſed in the ſame, eſpeciall pointes of doctryne touching God his prouidence,<note place="margin">Sundrie nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matters handled in this diſcourſe.</note> touching the true and righte vſe of his benefites, touching the vanitie of man his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and luſtes abuſing the good Creatures of GOD, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the true and ſound ſufficiencie or contentedneſſe of mind, and ſuch other like: and that with ſuch picked frame of wordes, with ſuch pithie ſtrength of ſentences, with ſuch a ſeuerall rowe of argumentes in ſo greate varyetye of matter, that the ſharpe wit of all the Philoſophers (and that in this common place of Felicitie or happineſſe, then whiche in all Philoſophie there is handled nothing more weightie and notable) compared with this treatiſe ſeemeth to be vtterly colde and of ſmall accountes.<note place="margin">The diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of al the philoſophers nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to this Sermon.</note> Which thing ſhal appeare by the reading of the diſcourſe it ſelf: it ſhal more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer be delightſome in the meane ſeaſon, ſeuerallye to pointe oute by ſetting downe the particular partes of the diſcourſe, the thinges whiche generally and breefely I haue ſhewed.</p>
            <div type="method">
               <head>This therefore is the particular diſtribution or handling of this whole diſcourſe.</head>
               <p>Firſt of all is layd downe the contrary part of the principal queſtion,<note place="margin">The diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and order of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> the which is at large handled from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning, euen vnto the end of the 4 chap. <hi>that felicitie or happines is not at all in thoſe thinges and affayres which are vſuall in this lyfe.</hi> Therefore is the generall propoſition ſet downe in the beginning by way of confutation, That all thinges which are vnder the ſunne are vayne, and that Felicitie is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in them.

               <p>Secondly he teacheth that it is not in <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> nor in the <hi>Wiſedome of man,</hi> by the ayde whereof notwithſtanding, it is thought that the life of man in euery reſpect may conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently be lead the which diſcourſe he continueth vnto the 16 verſe of the third chapter.<note place="margin">

Are not they amongſt men moſt happy, which directe their life according vnto her rule? And he conſidereth of vertue according vnto the maner of men, and not in regarde of her ſelfe, that is to ſay, according vnto that iſſue whiche it commeth vnto among men moſt vſually. <hi>Solomon</hi> maketh aunſwere, that ſuch are the affaires of men, that among ſo ſundrie and many tormentes of fortune, as they ſaye, vertue is not ſufficiently able to defende her ſelfe: nay that in that kinde of life there is ſometime great miſerye, becauſe that innocencie is many times iniured and oppreſſed vnder the pretence and title euen of law or iuſtice, and the very throne of iuſtice is the miniſter of great vngodlineſſe and iniuſtice: alſo in the common courſe of life, the beſt men often go to the pot, and the worſt of all ſit (as they ſay) on Cockhorſe. And in a thing ſo honourable and royall, this is the head of cheefeſt miſery, for that ouer and aboue the raunging of ſuche outrages in the life of man, and the rewarding of Godlineſſe with ſo pitifull a wages, yet notwithſtandinge the good doe die as well as the bad, as if death without any difference did ſwallow them vp, and in ſuch ſorte, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeemeth to be left after this life. For ſo doth man his reaſon iudge, whereof there cannot chuſe but be perceyued an infinite miſery of this mortall life, as if the eſtate of the deade, or of them which neuer liued, were farre better then the eſtate of them that liue. Which thing he doth from the ſixteenth verſe of the third chapter, vnto the fourth verſe of the fourth chapter.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſortes of life being after this maner examined, hee commeth vnto certain particular trades of life,<note place="margin">Single life.</note> and noteth thoſe in which ſeemeth to be eyther leſſe trouble, or more commoditie. <hi>The ſingle life is commended,</hi> as being quit and free from thoſe great encombrances, wherewith the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life is often loaden.<note place="margin">The life of Noble men.</note> The life of noble and great men by a certaine ſingular priuiledge ſeemeth to excell other kindes of life, yet he teacheth that happineſſe is neyther in the one
<pb facs="tcp:17735:9"/> nor the other: and therfore by the concluſion of the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he confirmeth that generall ſentence: <hi>that al is vanity:</hi> the which (as we haue ſayd) he was to proue by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation firſt of all, before that he ſhewed the contrary: that is to ſay, both what true happineſſe is, and by what meanes we attaine therevnto.</p>
               <p>Before he come to that ſecond point, hee ſetteth downe certayne thinges in the maner of a Praeface. For meaning to place true happineſſe in the feare of the Lord, that is, in the true knowledge of GOD, he teacheth that it is not a certaine outward obſeruing and keeping of ceremonies, or a boſting of Religion, conſiſting in many wordes: and this hee doth from the fourth chapter, verſe ſeuenteenth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſixte verſe of the fifte Chapter, and afterwarde doeth ſo diſcourſe the matter, that breefely ſhewing and ſetting downe the ſumme of the whole diſputation in theſe words, Feare God, he ſheweth the vſe thereof fully and throughlye euen vnto the laſt end of the booke, which is the third parte of the whole diſputation.</p>

Herevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taking occaſion in the 10 chap. he ſetteth down a moſt holy precept concerning Charity, to helpe the poore, albeit there appeare no hope of recouering of that which we giue vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the 12. chap. applying that doctrine vnto yong men, the which do moſt neede the ſame, he teacheth a moſt hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome &amp; neceſſary leſſon, <hi>Soberly to vſe this life, &amp; with the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thinking vpon death,</hi> as it were with a bit to holde in and rule the delites and wanton pleaſures thereof, and not to let paſſe the occaſion to doe well: leaſt we be ouertaken with death at vnwares. Therefore he warneth yong men in their flouriſhing and ſtrong age, earneſtly to think vpon old age, yea and alſo death it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>So he maketh an end of the whole diſputation, and as the rules of a true demonſtration doe require, he ſetteth downe the ſumme of the diſputation in plaine words, <hi>The end of the whole law is heard, Feare God, &amp;c.</hi> Of which words doubtleſſe the contents and matter of the whole diſputation is to bee iudged, as if he ſhould ſay: <hi>That which was to be proued.</hi> And he doth in ſuch ſort note the chiefe and principall ende, that he doth withall ſhew the cheefe and eſſentiall partes of the diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> He declareth by way of praeface that he bringeth not theſe thinges neither from the opinion of the common people, nor from the ſchooles of man his wiſedome, but fetcheth out of the very ſtorehouſe of the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the Church of God, grounded on ſure ſentences of God his decrees, as namely that happines conſiſteth in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and in the true vſe therof, that is in the keeping of the commandements of God: That this is all man, or the whole of man, that is the principall and cheefe end of man his life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:17735:11"/> the maſter end, as they vſe to ſpeake. Finally that God by his prouidence doth wiſely order things that are entangled, and will in his time repaire them.</p>
               <p>The iſſue therfore of the whole diſputation is perfect and ful. That happineſſe is not to be founde in thinges of this world: That the ſame doth conſiſt in godlineſſe, to wit, by the which we are ioyned vnto God, that we maye obtayne life euerlaſting, that is, true and perfect happineſſe: that the vſe and profit of Godlineſſe is very great and very excellent, the which doth plentifully flow through all the parts of our life.</p>

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee muſt alſo knowe this, that alwayes the chiefe light of the worde of God is to be ſought out of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt deliuered by his Apoſtles, leaſt any man ſhould thinke that we doe ſo commend one, and the ſame light of the fathers before Chriſt, that by the comming of Chriſt him ſelfe we did not perceiue the ſonne to haue ſhined more brightly then at noone day.</p>

The ſeuerall partes of the induction we ſhall examine in their places. This is the generall propoſition,<note place="margin">The generall propoſition.</note> 
                     <hi>Vanitie of vanities, &amp;c.</hi> that is to ſay, whatſoeuer is in this life, is moſt vaine, neither can there any thing be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Yea in a word man himſelfe is but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bubble. Is there any man therefore well in his wittes which will thinke that he can finde happineſſe in man? This is the framing and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the argument. Now the wordes are to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>He firſt of all affirmeth that he ſaith this, to ſhewe that he doth not bring any vncertaine and doubtfull matter, but a doctrine of full and vndoubted credite: and ſuch in deede, as chiefely doth belong vnto the office of a <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An eſpeciall duetie of a Preacher.</note> who eſpecially ought to labour this, that man may be prooued guiltie of vanitie, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17735:21"/> through this knowledge of his frailtie and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption be brought vnto God, of whom he muſt begge and haue remedie of his miſerie.</p>
                  <p>Now this propoſition is ſet forth with great garniſhment of figures.<note place="margin">Subſtantiues in ſtead of adiectiues.</note> Subſtantiues are vſed in ſtead of adiectiues for the more forcible and earneſt expreſsing of the matter, where he ſaieth, <hi>Vanitie of vanities:</hi> as if not onely the things appertaining vnto men were vaine, but alſo men themſelues vaine and moſt vaine, yea and vainer then vanitie it ſelfe, and as it were an heape of all vanities together.<note place="margin">Repetition of the ſame wordes.</note> Alſo the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame wordes doeth giue a weight and increaſe vnto the ſentence.

                  <p>And further by this name <hi>All</hi> (as we haue alreadie taught out of the ſecond rule) he doth not vnderſtand all things created ſimplie in themſelues,<note place="margin">What is to be vnderſtood by this word (all)</note> but ſuch things as are belonging vnto man, that is to ſay, counſailes, affaires, all actions, which are vſuall in this life, leaſt wee might ſuppoſe the nature of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be here condemned, the which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God hath made. For his purpoſe is to ſpeake of man his happineſſe, that is, ſo farre as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17735:22"/> happineſſe may befall vnto man: and when as he was to prooue, that man is moſt farre from the ſame, he was alſo to ſet downe his vanitie, &amp; not the vanitie of other creatures. And therfore I do not hold with them the which do ſuppoſe that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh generally of all things. For albeit that it be true, that the creatures which otherwiſe are good, are but meere vanitie if they be compared with God, becauſe there is in them nothing firme nor ſtable: yet that doth nothing at all agree with the proper meaning of this place. For his purpoſe is to ſpeake of man.<note place="margin">Nazianzen.</note> Therefore <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in his Paraphraſis doth thus expound theſe words: <hi>How vaine and vnprofitable are the things and endeuours of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what ſoeuer are belonging vnto men.</hi> Yet is it notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding true, that the vanitie of man hath rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But the meaning of this place is ſimple and plaine, namelie, that in the affaires of men, in their buſines and actions there is great vanitie, and therefore happineſſe is away from them: as which are miſerable, full of trouble, vnquiet, comberſome, fleeting &amp; vnſtable through vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine alterations, and in a word altogether in bondage vnto corruption.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17735:27"/> wil iudge: albeit that it be diuerſly expounded by the interpreters. Some thinke that it is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſimilitude taken from the motions of the ſunne and of the waters, ſo that in theſe ſhould be ſet forth as it were a picture of the vnſtedfaſtneſſe and turning vp and downe of the like miſeries in the affaires of men, the which miſeries can not be letted neither by the deuiſe, nor wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of man, that it ſhould be a moſt ſimple applying of the ſimilitude thus: like as the Sunne and the water haue continuall turnings and goings about, ſo the affaires of men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the miſeries which are mixed with them, are turned vp and downe, neither can the troubles at any hand be letted by the counſaile or wiſedome of man.

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſuppoſe that it is no ſimilitude, but that theſe things are alleaged for themſelues, to confirme the general propoſition, <hi>Al is vanitie,</hi> So that <hi>Solomon</hi> beginneth at the very groundes and cauſes of things, that is, with ſuch things as by their reſtleſſe motion declare their vanitie: and as concerning the Sunne they ſay that he plainely ſpeaketh theſe things, the which is the cauſe of the generation and deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theſe

And that therefore the concluſion is after this maner, That man is not able in wordes to vtter the wearineſſe of thoſe things, how greatly they are dayly chaunged, and neuer continue in one eſtate. Some thinke that the ſtudies of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers are found fault withall, wherewith they ſearch out the natures and cauſes of things, as if this were euill, and not able to be vttered. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers iudge that this is the plaine meaning of theſe wordes, That the vanitie of man is ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and manifolde, that it can by no meanes be expreſſed in wordes.</p>

                  <p>What then?

And by that which followeth, or which may be concluded hereupon ought to be vnderſtood that the wit it ſelfe is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ynough to conceiue them, for the things which we conceiue in mind, we vtter by ſpeach: and reaſon goeth before ſpeach: and ſpeach is the waiter and ſeruant of reaſon.

Namely that the things and affaires belonging vnto men are ſuch, that they can hard and ſcarſely be comprehended and conceiued, becauſe they are carried about with vnſtedfaſt and vncertaine chaunging, and for that the ſame runne backe againe as it were in a certaine circle, and with a wandering violence are driuen about too and fro: whereby their vncertaintie and inconſtancie may be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Therefore that there is nothing new, but that the ſelfe ſame thing in diuerſe ages doth after a diuerſe ſort ariſe and come vp againe, ſo that nothing can be defined or found out. He vſeth an asking of a queſtion for the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and making plaine of the matter, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth the ſame ſpeache in two verſes all to

                  <p n="10">10 &amp; 11. <hi>There is ſome thing]</hi> For this is no new argument, but a garniſhing of the olde. And this kinde of ſpeache vſed after the maner of imitation, or counterfaiting of another man his ſpeach, giueth a light and beautifying vnto the ſentence: like as alſo theſe wordes, <hi>There is no remembrance, &amp;c.</hi> are vſed to amplifie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the matter in this ſenſe, Like as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of things done before, ſo farre as appertaineth vnto vs, is periſhed, ſo alſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the things that are nowe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our poſteritie, ſhall after the like maner periſh: for the things which are now done of vs, and are preſent vnto vs, ſhall be paſt vnto our poſteritie.

                  <p>And by the word <hi>VViſedome,</hi> euery man ſeeth that he vnderſtandeth the wiſedome of man: but of what things he here ſpeaketh (for the ſubiect or matter whereabout the wiſedome of man is occupied is of many ſortes)<note place="margin">Diuers iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this place.</note> the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the learned is diuerſe. For many doe thinke that <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not ſpeake of any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall conſideration or of the workes of God (for theſe are their expreſſe wordes) that is to ſay, of nature, and naturall things, about the conſideration whereof the wit and labour of man doth oftentimes ſweate and take paine: but that he ſpeaketh of the conſideration of counſailes, actions and iſſues of things in the gouernment of man concerning the common wealth or priuate families, ſo that the meaning ſhould be: I determined with my ſelfe to ſet my things in verie good order, to ſtrengthen and eſtabliſh my kingdome after a verie excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent maner: but I perceiued and learned by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that there fell out vnto me good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe

And that this is the meaning of this place, they ſay doth apeare by this kind of ſpeaking, <hi>vnder the Sunne,</hi> by the which <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> is wont to ſignifie the affaires of men: and that the workes of God and Nature are not hemmed in within ſo narrow boundes.

If he ſhould intreat of man his prudence, it ſhould be a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> plaine babling, from the which this moſt wiſe diſcourſe is moſt farre: for he will ſpeake here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at large in the next Chapter. Moreouer, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the rules of a Demonſtration will not ſuffer it, which bid that the chiefe partes be diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconed vp in the Induction: But ſuch a chiefe parte ſhould be ouerpaſſed, in the which thoſe men, who thinke that they are wiſer then others, are wont to place felicitie or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Laſtly, the wordes themſelues, vnto the which the meaning muſt be altogether an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable

                  <p>Therefore I thinke that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh of that kinde of ſearching, the which doeth not onely looke vnto a familie and citie, and vnto the ſocietie and fellowſhip of mankynde,<note place="margin">He ſpeaketh of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all Philoſophie.</note> but alſo with deepe and exquiſite order doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde and conſider the cauſes and effectes of Nature it ſelfe, and the multitude of thoſe myracles, which are extant in this Theater of the worlde, tryeth out and bringeth vnto light the principles and groundes of things, and that which is general and ſimple, as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of true knowledge, and mounteth vp moſt farre aboue nature, euen vnto GOD himſelfe.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17735:44"/> that ſame power which is graffed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man to know the trueth: whereof he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Alpheſtes</hi> that is to ſay, a ſearcher out, the which ſeedes of things are to be garniſhed in time, with learning and paines taking.

So the Apoſtle attributeth wiſedom vnto them which weakened the ſimplicitie of the croſſe, that is all the efficacie &amp; ſtrength of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1. Cor. 1.17. He afterwards layeth downe the matter of this finding out and ſearching. <hi>Whatſoeuer is done vnder heauen,</hi> that is to ſay, whatſoeuer is in the nature of things. For he ſetteth downe this worde <hi>Heauen,</hi> as ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thing of more maieſtie in the good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlineſſe of Nature, for that it hath power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the things beneath it. He ſayth then, <hi>vnder Heauen,</hi> not as if the minde of man did wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vp and downe ſeeking alſo aboue Heauen: but becauſe theſe thinges that may be ſeene are for the moſt parte the matter whereabout humane ſciences are occupyed, and for that, whatſoeuer men do otherwiſe determine, all theſe cogitations are bounded within theſe liſtes and limits. For whereas the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers do diſpute of things intelligible, or that may be vnderſtanded and ſeparate from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17735:44"/> they are the ſhapes of thinges and not thinges themſelues that haue their being, like as the more ſounder among them haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged.</p>
                  <p>This was his ſtudie, this was his indeuour to attaine vnto moſt excellent knowledge.

For how many at this day were godly ignorance better then wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked learning, wherewith being blinded, they runne headlong into the phrenſie of Atheiſme or thinking that there is no God, and being puffed vp with the ſwelling of that counterfait know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they cannot away with the ſimplicitie of the truth which is taught in the Church of God.

And againſt all theſe phrenſies and errours wee are to ſet the ſimplicitie of the worde of God, the which to be the vndoubted wiſedome we make no doubt at all.

                  <head>The expoſition.</head>
                  <p>All this whole place from the 2. Chapter verſe. 3. vnto the 3. Chapter, verſe 15. I read in one courſe and text together. For all theſe things are alleaged to proue one and the ſelfe ſame thing, namely, vnto the confutation of the Prudence of man, the which <hi>Solomon</hi> doth therefore plead giltie of vanitie, to ſhut out fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie or happineſſe from it, and to proue this newe propoſition, <hi>There is alſo great vanitie in the prudence of man:</hi> Like as he had alreadie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued concerning <hi>VViſedome</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> Vnder the name therefore of <hi>VViſedome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What kinde of wiſedom is here ſpoken of, and how it differeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore going.</note> he doth not vnderſtande the ſame wiſedome the which hee hath ſpoken of in the Chapter before going, namely a ſearcher and ſeeker out of thinges by ſtudie of minde and meditation, but a ciuil Prudence: by the which, man being a liuing creature indued with reaſon, and delighting in companie, doth knowe how to gouerne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his familie, and alſo the common wealth: and doth wiſely iudge of the diſpoſing and ſucceſſe of thinges, the which no doubt is an eſpecial point of wiſedom. For what ſhould it auaile to knowe the miracles and wonders of nature, vnleſſe thou diddeſt knowe thy ſelfe? What ſhould it auaile to vnderſtande the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17735:60"/> and the motions of things, the greatneſſe of the ſtarres, their diſtances one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and their mouings, and to comprehende &amp; conceiue by contemplation the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, vnleſſe thou ſhouldeſt knowe wiſely how to gouerne thy ſelfe, thy familie, the citie, in the which thou dwelleſt? And therefore the ſounder Philoſophers are commended,<note place="margin">The practiſe of the more ſounder Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers.</note> the which, whereas others of elder times beſtowed all their labour and ſtudie in the laying open of nature, and diſcourſes of <hi>Meteores</hi> or thinges done aboue and in the ayer, they contrariwiſe called downe Philoſophie as it were from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and placed her in cities, and brought her into houſes, and cauſed her to enquire of life &amp; manners, and of good things and euill things, that is to ſaye, they diligently taught Ethikes, or concerning Manners, Oeconomikes, or con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning houſhold gouernement, and politikes, or concerning the ruling of cities &amp; common wealthes. Nowe therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> plainly and expreſſely dealeth with man his prudence and wiſedome, and proueth the ſame giltie of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as hitherto he hath done all knowledge in generall. And he doth in ſuch ſort deſcribe &amp; ſet forth the ſame, that it can not be more liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented or expreſſed. For as prudence hath her ſpeculation, and her Precepts, ſo alſo is ſhee eſpecially to be ſeene and perceiued in the actions and vſes of life. He therefore dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth exactly or throughly with them both vnto
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17735:61"/> the full deſcription of the ſame: alleaging alſo his owne example, to ſhewe that he ſpeaketh principally of a thing certaine &amp; well knowen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Solomon doth not ſimply condemne the wiſedome of man.</note>Nowe, according vnto the firſt rule, the which wee haue ſet downe at the beginning, wee are to note, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh of this matter after the manner of men, that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of man his reaſon: leaſt wee ſhoulde thinke that he condemneth Prudence or the wiſedome of man in it ſelfe, that is to ſay, the way to order our life wel and temperatly, to gouerne our family wiſely and duely, to rule the common wealth profitably, and the wit to iudge of thinges likely to fall out hereafter, by the long and diligent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of things gone before, that wee may prouide both for our ſelues, and for our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and for the common wealth, and may know the way to order the ſocietie and felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of man commodiouſly, and to preſerue it, among the horrible tempeſtes of mens deuiſes and practiſes. The knowledge of all the which things Prudence or the wiſedome of man doth promiſe &amp; profeſſe: but how farre, &amp; to what effect, it ſhall appeare by this ſermon.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <note place="margin">Solomon took a middle courſe of life.</note>3 <hi>I haue ſearched out]</hi> The meaning is, that he folowed a wiſe and perfect courſe of a ciuil life, in betaking himſelfe vnto a certaine mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle kinde of life, that he might both withdraw himſelfe from a diſſolute or reachleſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate life, and yet not forgoe and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17735:61"/> ſuch things, which might make for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing pleaſantly &amp; merily: nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlewe thoſe things which might beſeem a wiſe and a thriftie perſon. But did throughly labor in that which appertained vnto the leading of his life wel &amp; bleſſedly. That this is the power and force of the wiſedome of man, there is no man well experienced in the affaires of the worlde which doubteth. The Philoſophers which haue diſcourſed of maners, haue taught that vertue is a meane: and in politike me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuch as are wont moſt to be praiſed, is that mean or middle way to be ſeene, that they ſhunniſh the foule &amp; frantike outrages of diſſolute &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perſons, &amp; yet fall not into a ſterne club<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhnes, hating all companie and fellowſhip of men: (which kinde of melancholike ſadneſſe &amp; neuer being merrie, is often ſeene in thoſe that are to much giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto ſtudie) but do loue a pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; merrie life, &amp; do folow honeſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: yet are delited conueniently as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerueth with the ſtudie of learning &amp; honeſt thinges, and ſeeke that delite both of quiet &amp; buſineſſe. And more ouer they do wiſely and painfully look vnto the matters of their houſe, &amp; order them finely: and do not caſt away the care of the common wealth, nor take ſuch a courſe as that they wil liue by themſelues, and meddle with no matters of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, but doe both iudge wiſely of worldly matters, and diligently employ their labour about the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17735:62"/> common wealth, as occaſion ſhall require: yet neuertheleſſe will they not intermeddle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in troubleſome caſes, but endeuour to prouide both for themſelues and for theirs. That this is a liuely image of a prudent or wiſe and ciuil man, there is none but ſeeth certaine ſuch like branches whereof (if the calamities of their countrey would haue ſuffered) the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories do ſet forth vnto vs in <hi>Lucullus,</hi> in <hi>Cicero,</hi> in <hi>Themistocles:</hi> and in a more liuely image, and in a matter farre more weightie, the holie hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie doth portraite out vnto vs in <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Solomon a patterne of a politike life.</note> ſo that not vnworthilie hath he ſhewed himſelfe a patterne of a politike life: the which he doth here artificially ſet out.</p>
                  <p>He vſeth therefore a verie fine frame of wordes,<note place="margin">To ſearch in the heart.</note> ſaying, <hi>That he ſearched in his heart,</hi> that is to ſay, that he weighed and conſidered in his mind a certain other courſe of liuing ciuilly, &amp; royally, that forſaking thoſe extremes of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall &amp; of a diſſolute or rechleſſe life, he would moderately betake himſelfe vnto a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine middle way. <hi>That he would draw out his fleſh in wine.</hi> The Hebrew word ſignifieth to <hi>drawe</hi> or to <hi>drawe out.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The worde, Wine.</note> By this worde <hi>VVine,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the proprietie of the Hebrew toung is ſignified a merrie and pleaſant kinde of life. The meaning therefore is, how he might moſt giue him ſelfe vnto pleaſantneſſe, and deliuer himſelfe from cares and troubles: <hi>yet might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his heart vnto wiſedome,</hi> accuſtome him ſelfe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17735:62"/> vnto wiſedome, that is to ſaye, ſo follow plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that he might ſeeke after a prudent &amp; wiſe courſe of liuing. And <hi>that he might lay holde on follie,</hi> that is, not abſtaine from a more free and merrie life, not ſo to giue himſelf vnto the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of wiſedome, but that ſometimes he might giue himſelfe leaue to followe pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>This is the plaine &amp; cleare meaning of theſe worde:<note place="margin">Againſt ſuch, as out of this place would eſtabliſh Monkerie.</note> ſo that the dotage of fooliſh Sophiſters is to be deteſted, who through the ignorance of the Hebrewe toung (being diſceiued by the wordes of the common tranſlation) would out of theſe wordes builde the madde deuiſe of a Monkiſh life. But this by no meanes can bee gathered of the wordes: and <hi>Ierome</hi> (otherwiſe a blinde patrone of Monkerie) doth expounde this place after this manner:<note place="margin">Ierom.</note> 
                     <hi>I was minded to lead my life in pleaſures, and to deliuer my fleſh from all cares, and to bring my ſelfe a ſleepe with pleaſure, as it were with wine, &amp;c.</hi> Alſo againſt thoſe idols and counterfaiting of temperance, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie and reproch of an honeſt and ſober life, (for this is the deſcription of a Monkiſh life) we haue to oppoſe and ſet the decree of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ghoſt againſt the vnprofitable vſing of bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe. 1. Tim. 4. ver. 8.</p>
                  <p>Nowe to what ende <hi>Solomon</hi> followed this middle kind of life, he teacheth in theſe words, <hi>vntil that I did ſee,</hi> that is to ſay, had learned &amp; aſſuredly tryed out by experience, <hi>what was that good thing of the ſonnes of men, that they might la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17735:63"/> vnder Heauen, in the number of the days of their life:</hi> that is to ſay, How this life of man might be led wel and bleſſedly: what is the right way to order and diſpoſe a man his life well and profitably. For ſo are thoſe wordes ſimply to be expounded, <hi>vnder Heauen,</hi> that is to ſaye in this life: <hi>In the number of the dayes of their life,</hi> that is to ſaye, So long as men liue here in this world, ſo long as they remaine in this life. The ſumme and effect is: When as he had founde happineſſe neither in the ſearching out of the myſteries and ſecrets of knowledge, nor yet in the diſſolutenes of pleaſure, that he tooke an other courſe to ſeeke out that happineſſe, that auoyding thoſe two extremes, hee might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a certaine middle kinde of life, the which did neither refuſe pleaſure, nor yet the ſtudie of wiſdome: &amp; that he did this to this ende, that he might know what was the right courſe for men to liue. And what way &amp; courſe he tooke to obtaine this ende, he himſelf will by and by declare.</p>

Houſhold and priuate goods are the foundation of a common wealth, and the foundation of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie is the skill to thriue, that is to ſaye, the meanes and diligence to gather wealth &amp; heap vp riches. He witneſſeth,<note place="margin">Solomon gaue himſelfe to gather ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> that he diligently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed himſelfe hereunto, and ſetteth downe a liuely deſcription of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>He ſayeth therefore generally, <hi>that he magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his workes,</hi> that is to ſay, that he handled his matters famouſly and royally, the which royall and famous adminiſtration and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of things of his,<note place="margin">All theſe things are lawfull being rightly vſed.</note> he by and by doth ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſet downe. That he builded houſes, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vineyards, made orchardes &amp; parkes, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them trees of al fruits: made him ponds of water to water the wood, got men ſeruants and maide ſeruants, cattell, had a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſeruants borne in his houſe, and finally, heaped vp vnto himſelf great riches, &amp; added vnto this royaltie a great number of ſinging men and ſinging women, as kings and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie men are wont to doe, all which things doe appertaine vnto ſuch an adminiſtration &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of an houſhold, as in all pointes is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and perfect, ſo that there be a right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to vſe them, the which <hi>Solomon</hi> forthwith

                     <hi>And all thinges which mine eyes deſired, &amp;c.</hi> that is to ſay, that hee permitted vnto himſelfe the moſt franke vſe of his goods, not like vnto couetous ſwinepan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, which dare not touch their bread &amp; wine, but gape after their riches the which they haue with great toyle heaped vp.

The ſumme and effect is: that he let paſſe nothing, whiche might appertaine vnto an happie and bleſſed life, ſo farre as ciuile men could attaine vnto.

He hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out that part of Prudence, the which is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in the direction of houſholde matters: the which in deede of it ſelfe is of great weight vnto the vſe of life.<note place="margin">Solomon nowe handleth the cheefeſt parte of prudence.</note> And now he doth at large and excellently ſet downe that whiche is the chiefeſt and moſt notable parte of Prudence, namely that which iudgeth of the whole life: the which teacheth what is good, what is euill, what agreeable, what diſagreeable: iudgeth of ſuch thinges as fall out in the life of man, wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grounds and cauſes of men their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and therefore preſcribeth counſaile to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the iſſues of things, that a happy end maye follow, ſheweth the danger that it may be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17735:70"/> The Bookes of Politikes or of ſuch as haue written of common wealth matters are full of this excellent knowledge, and the counſailes of prudent men are directed by the guidance and helpe hereof. It is likely that ſo families &amp; Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were founded and ordeined, that ſo great Empires ſprang vp and were increaſed, and that ſo the ſame were maintained &amp; preſerued. But what is the ſucceſſe of this ciuile prudence or wiſdome. <hi>Solomon</hi> being taught alſo by his own trial and experience, will tell vs hereafter: now he teacheth what it is, &amp; vpon how ſure ground he ſpeaketh of the ſame.</p>

Ciuile Prudence or Wiſedome is queſtionleſſe a moſte principall and profitable part of Philoſophie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the naming agayne of the ſame wordes doth very well agree vnto it. The ſumme and effect is, that he ſpeaketh not of a thing that is vncertaine, but whereof hee had good triall, knowledge and experience, as about the ſtudie whereof, he raunged not (as they ſaye) ouer the fieldes, but tooke great payne and laboure, and diligently gaue himſelfe vnto the ſearching out of all the partes thereof.

The very expres ſignifications of the hebrew text word for word is thus: <hi>What is man whiche ſhoulde come after the King vnto thoſe thinges whiche they haue done alreadye?</hi> Some (as many of the Rabbines, as Ierome) by the worde King vnderſtande God:<note place="margin">The hebrew words I haue left out of pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe I ſuppoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> needleſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant reader.</note> and that in ſundrye ſences, eyther that we oughte to bee content with the workes of God: nor ſeeke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further thinges then that which is made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, and that we ought not to find fault with his workes: as wicked Carpers vſe to doe: or, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> After the pronouncing of God his decree, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God is not to bee prayed vnto to reuoke it or call it back agayn, when as it can by no meanes bee called backe againe, but whilſte wee haue

But this expoſition, albeit that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine a very profitable doctrine, yet it doeth not agree with the wordes and meaning.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17735:71"/> I thinke that this is the plain meaning of theſe wordes, I acknowledge in this place no want of words, or ſuppreſsing any thing in ſilence, that is to be otherwiſe ſupplied, when as the wordes themſelues may be expounded clearely, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the matter it ſelfe.

Before the trueth can be taught vnto any profit, firſt of all
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17735:83"/> it is requiſite that the cloudes of falſhood bee ſcattered and driuen away, becauſe that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the common opinion growing in the mindes of men, it is wont to ſpreade ouer them daungerous darkneſſe.<note place="margin">Firſt of all we muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to refute falſhood.</note> Therefore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing of falſhood ought to be our firſt care: but as the ſame is manifolde, ſo wee muſt vſe many ſortes of engines to ouerthrowe the ſame, that it being fitly put to flight, the trueth may be auouched fitly and ſafely. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> hath dwelt long in the confuting of thoſe things, in the which the reaſon of man imagineth happineſſe for to bee. In all things hee had founde vanitie and vexation of ſpirite: but eſpecially in the prudence of man, againſt the which the combate is moſt daungerous. Againſt this vanitie, which is a moſt aſſured note of vnhappineſſe, he ſhould haue matched ſufficiencie or contentedneſſe, the which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is a true note of happineſſe. But the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this ſufficiencie or contentedneſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is to be ſtrongly prooued, that there may be made a full demonſtration of happines.

Of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tietie and contentedneſſe of minde hee nowe intreateth, oppoſing and matching it (as wee haue ſayde before) againſt the vanitie of all thoſe things the which do fall out in this life: yet taking fitly occaſion of ſpeache from that thing, in which hee prooued by ſure argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments greateſt vanitie to bee, that is, in the wiſedome of man, wherein by the iudgement and opinion of man his reaſon greater ſatietie and contentedneſſe ſeemed to ſhine foorth.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:17735:84"/> more expreſſeth the meaning, as if he ſhoulde ſaye, After that it is founde out, that there is great vanitie in euerie trade of life, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in that laſt ende, were it not beſt for a man, and moſt excellent, ſetting aſide this ſo great carefulneſſe of minde, to vſe and enioye with a quiet and pleaſaunt minde the thinges which hee hath gotten with lawfull laboure, and aſcribing thoſe benefites vnto the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of GOD, with thankes giuing to applye them vnto the ſounde vſe? <hi>Therefore hee calleth, to eate and drinke,</hi>

                  <p>The ſumme and effecte is, that the ſounde and pleaſaunt vſe of the thinges themſelues doeth farre excell penſiue and troubleſome carefulneſſe: and therefore as in the one there is great vanitie, ſo in the other there is a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and an happie ſatietie or contentedneſſe of mind. That this is the true and right meaning of theſe wordes, the readers will nothing at
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17735:85"/> all doubt, beeing enuironed with the helpe of thoſe rules, which wee haue ſet downe at the beginning, and wiſely conſidering the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of this place. For it is an vnciuill thing to giue iudgement of a whole lawe by ſome one braunche of the ſame lawe. Wee muſt alſo weigh the purpoſe of the ſpeaker: the which not being rightly perceiued and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode,<note place="margin">Great wrong don vnto So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, by foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh perſons not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his meaning.</note> it cannot be choſen, but that wee ſhall aſcribe vnto him fooliſh fancies beſides his meaning. As in this and ſuch like places frantike perſons haue done great wrong vnto <hi>Solomon,</hi> whileſt that they thinke him to bee an vpholder of Epicure like phrenſies, as if hee ſhoulde teache that the ſoueraigne and chiefe good of man did conſiſt herein, if hee followe his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>But the bare wordes themſelues, are not to bee conſidered them ſelues by themſelues, and ſeuerally, but by the purpoſe of the ſpeaker, &amp; being ioyned with the whole ſentence. Chriſt biddeth, that if one giue vs a blowe on the one cheeke,<note place="margin">Not the bare words, but the purpoſe of the ſpeaker is to be conſidered in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> wee ſhoulde holde him the other to ſtrike. He biddeth, that if one hande offende vs, that we cut him off: if an eye, that we pull him out: that wee ſhould gelde our ſelues for the kingdome of God, and ſuch like. If a man will ſticke vnto the bare wordes, not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the purpoſe of Chriſt: how monſtrous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ſhould he father vppon him, that is how fond &amp; fooliſh ſhould him ſelf be, like as <hi>Origen,</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:17735:85"/> who being accuſtomed to defile the plaine and naked truth, with the ſlabberſauce and dunge of allegories, expounded theſe words ſimplye, which are altogether allegoricall, and went in deede and gelded himſelfe: when as he rather ſhould haue renounced his philoſophical pride wherewith he turned the truth into a lie, and ſhould haue bene wiſe according vnto the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the word of God, which kind of gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of himſelfe, ſhould haue bene both accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto God, &amp; profitable vnto the churche of God, and alſo vnto himſelfe. The Prophet denieth that God euer commaunded the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Iewes to ſacrifice vnto him, &amp; doth deteſt all the ceremonies, yea and alſo the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it ſelfe. Who is hee that ſeeth not, that the bare wordes, ſo as they do plainely ſounde, are diſagreeing from the truth, and therefore that they neede interpretation? For the truth is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vnto it ſelf. But nothing is more force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then thoſe kind of ſpeeches, neither could any thing be deuiſed more euident and plaine and the darkeneſſe is not in them but in oure mindes, namely by thoſe exceſſiue ſpeeches of words, the dulneſſe of men is to be ſhaken of, which are nothing at all moued with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and vſuall maner of ſpeaking. Chriſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meaneth, that iniuries are patiently to be borne, and that thus farre,<note place="margin">The meaning of the former ſayings.</note> that we do not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der euill for euill, and that we ſhoulde redeeme peace, although it were to our own priuate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17735:86"/> Hee will haue vs to renounce al thinges, yea euen oure owne ſelues, that wee maye ſerue God freely, being diſcharged of all buſineſſe, the whiche mighte lette oure free courſe: and therefore hee doeth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde vs after the manner of bedlames, with madde violence to rage agaynſt oure owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, neyther doth hee bereaue vs of common ſence and reaſon, nor forbiddeth lawful means of putting away iniurie. That theſe thinges are ſpoken truelye, and according vnto the meaning, no man well in his wittes will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: like as that ſame preciſe denuntiation or bolde ſaying of <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſpeaking according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſuppoſition of the Iewes (becauſe that from their Ceremonies they ſhut out fayth,<note place="margin">The place of Ieremie.</note> the foundation of the worſhip of God) for in this reſpecte he denyeth that God commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ceremonies vnto the Iewes. But that ſame lightning of ſpeeche was more fitte to terrifye and make afrayde the boldneſſe of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, whiche doe ſinne, not of ignorance of the will of GOD, but of a lewde and wicked mynde, as the Prophet teacheth, more at large in that ſermon.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Examples haue I alleaged, to ſhewe that in ſuche preciſe and ſtraighte kinde of ſpeeches wee muſte not ſticke vnto the bare wordes, but that the ſentence it ſelfe is to bee conſidered: and by it to giue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of the wordes: that whiche ſeemed

                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayth that this only is good &amp; profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto man, to eat &amp; drink: ſhal we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande theſe wordes in this ſence and meaning as wee doe theſe of the Epicures,<note place="margin">How this place of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is to be vnderſtood.</note>

The purpoſe of <hi>Solomon</hi> is to be wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the whole ſentence is to be examined, that wee may clearelye vnderſtande the force of the wordes, and to what ende they are aleaged. His purpoſe therefore is to teache by remedie of what thinges that vanitie may be cured,<note place="margin">The purpoſe of Solomon.</note> the which he hath ſhewed to be in all the counſails and enterpriſes of men. He ſetteth downe as a remedie againſt this, the ſound and pleaſaunte vſe of the thinges themſelues: This he calleth <hi>To eate and drinke</hi> that is, ſoundly to enioy thoſe externall and outward thinges, the which doe appertaine vnto the nouriſhment of the body. And hee addeth a playne expoſition. <hi>To ſhewe his Soule good of his laboure,</hi> and leaſt hee mighte ſeeme to ſpeake of prophane and Epicure-lyke Gurmandize in eating and drinkinge,

Who then (vnleſſe he be a very foole) wil ſay that in this place the opinion of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picures is maintained?<note place="margin">Solomon doth not maintaine the opinion of the Epicures.</note> And he vſeth of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the words of Eating and drinking, &amp; that more clearely and expreſly, then if he had ſette downe common and vſuall wordes. For his meaning was to compare pleaſure with the Prudence of man, this vanitie whereof he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fault with in theſe laſt words, that it cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the things which it hath gotten with great labour: but in pleaſure there is at leaſt wiſe a pleaſant feeling of the thinges themſelues, and ſome preſent fruite is reaped. And the moſte ſimple vſe of honeſt pleaſure is, to eate and drinke, and neceſſarie prouiſion for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynance of life, the which thoſe that are moſt preciſe cannot ſimply condemne. Therefore he ſayth afterwards, That our whole labour is for our mouth, that is to ſay, that men laboure to this ende, that they maye haue wherewith to maintaine this life, and he ſayde, <hi>To eat of their goods,</hi> for, to enioy and vſe their goods. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, theſe words are not ſpoken by way of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, in the perſon of Belli-gods and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures: but they teach the true and right vſe of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17735:87"/> the giftes of God, as it is by him ordeyned, and they doe limite it out by the ſimple meaſure of eating and drinking, and doe will theſe gifts to be of vs receaued pleaſantly and merily, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that wee maye both acknowledge and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God the autor and giuer of them al. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he addeth, that the vſe of bodily benefites alſo, is the gift of God, and that he hath ſeen it, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Godlines the foundation of contentednes.</note> vnderſtoode it by aſſured argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. Godlineſſe, no queſtion, is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that ſame ſatietie or contentedneſſe, of the which he will intreat in his place: neyther can it or ought it to be ſeuered from this true vſe by any meanes. For no man can haue true and ſound contentedneſſe of minde withoute godlineſſe, yet this is true, that God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon man many benefites and the ſame very great, not only to cheriſh the mind of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but alſo for the nouriſhing of his body, both for neceſſitie, and alſo for delite. For as God is the maker both of the minds and bodies, ſo he geueth vnto both that which is needeful and conuenient.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer he by and by ſetteth down (as we haue ſayd before) a garniſhing of the 24. verſe. For it was needful that this neceſſary doctrine ſhould diligently be beaten into our minds. He had ſayd that the good of man, that is true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:17735:108"/> chapter, vnto the third verſe of the fourth cha. Now the wordes are further to be conſidered. He ſayth agayne that he hath ſeene vnder the Sunne, that is to ſay, that he hath beheld in this life A place of iudgement, that is to ſaye, in a place appointed for the keepin of lawe, and in the whole adminiſtration of iuſtice and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, <hi>That there was vngodlineſſe,</hi> and <hi>in the place of Iuſtice that there alſo was vngodlineſse.</hi> For the ſame worde is repeated againe by a fyne dubling (which Fygure is termed <hi>Anadiploſis.</hi>) And by this word Vngodlineſſe, or, Iniquitye, it is manifeſte by the contrarye, that breache of Lawe is vnderſtoode, namelye that in that place, and by thoſe perſons, the whiche by God are made the Iudges of the Lawe, the lawe is broken. The worde Iuſtice is alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly repeated to amplifie the matter, by the worde Iudgement and Iuſtice hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth the right interpretation of lawes, that is to ſay, verye naturall equitie, vnchaungeable and euerlaſting right, which is the foundation of lawes. And by the worde <hi>Hatſedek,</hi> the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of lawes, the which are the ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in of the felowſhip of men, and according vnto the forme whereof, the courſe of ciuile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ought to be diſcerned and ordered. If therfore in any place in the life of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, honeſtie and good dealing ought to ſhine forth, it ought eſpecially in thoſe places which are the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſeates of law &amp; iuſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet neuertheleſſe ſo

So vertue hath not her felicity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, the which ought of al men to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and defended, at leaſtwiſe of thoſe, who do profeſſe themſelues to be the keepers &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayners of good and honeſt thinges.<note place="margin">A golden world.</note> How true this is, lamentable experience doth inough and too much ſhew, In this golden world I meane, golden I ſaye in this reſpecte, that all thinges are to be ſolde for gold, faith for gold, iuſtice, for gold, lawes and whatſoeuer in this life is of moſt high &amp; precious account, is to be had for gold: yea the very thrones of iudgementes, the courtes of Kings and Princes, are not only the ſhoppes of theſe ſaleable arts, but publike the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aters and Stages of theſe haynous ſinnes, all ſhamefaſtneſſe being ſet aſide, ſo that righte and equity are to be ſolde at offer and proffer publikely,<note place="margin">The expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others</note> and for a ſette price. Some learned interpreters doe vnderſtand theſe words more largelye: that manye thinges are done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtlye in gouernementes that are not Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, and that how great paynes ſoeuer good Magiſtrates doe take, yet that they can not redreſſe theſe greate enormityes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they muſt tarrie vntil God amend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The whiche in deede is true, and by experience more true then were requiſite. <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechias</hi> being very good Princes, had in their
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:17735:109"/> courts ſuch vlcers, ſo that it is no maruaile that in the days of <hi>Ezechias</hi> the Prohets did ſo great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly complaine of the corruptions of that time. For good princes neither can haue an eye into all things, and manie things are done by their courtiers, that is to ſay, lewd and bad perſons, ſuch as they are wont to be, which are infected with the poyſon of the court. I ſay nothing of negligence and ignorance, the which in this warie and ſubtile worlde is onely ſeene in thoſe things which appertaine vnto the doing of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, there ignorance and negligence raungeth, and is eaſily excuſed. But when we haue to do for gaine, there great diligence, &amp; great quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſightedneſſe do raigne and flouriſh. Among theſe enormities of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, good lawes otherwiſe, ly dead and ſilent euen in the beſt ordered co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthes, I doe not doubt, but that this circumſtance doth after a ſort appertaine vnto this complaint: yet the firſt ſenſe is more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and more true.</p>

                  <p n="17">17 <hi>I ſaide in mine heart]</hi> when as I behelde theſe enormities,<note place="margin">A remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities of the world.</note> that ſo many thinges were wrongfully handled, that the gyltleſſe were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and that the giltie, not onely ſcaped ſcotfree, but alſo did wickedly triumph, I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led backe my ſelfe vnto the remedie. Therefore I entred into this conſideration with my ſelfe, as namely being taken from the word of God,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17735:110"/> 
                     <hi>God will iudge the iuſt and the vngodly:</hi> whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was otherwiſe before mine eyes, I ſurely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with my ſelfe, that God had regarde both of the godly, and alſo the vngodly: that theſe things in the life of man fell not out at all aduenture or by chaunce: but contrariwiſe, that God the gouernour of mankind, did for a time let loſe the bridle vnto lewd perſons, that at length hee might call them to giue accounts of their whole life, and, according as his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; office doth require, might render trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto wicked men which had troubled the good: and eaſe and reſt vnto the good, which had beene afflicted. For this doth the iuſtice, or rightfull iudgement of the iuſt God require, the which is not vnknown euen vnto the more pure iudgement of man his reaſon. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an argument taken from the nature &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of God the Iudge. But becauſe in this life many things are done amiſſe, and diſorderly, he calleth backe our mindes from this diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red time vnto the time of the reſtoring of all things. <hi>Becauſe there is a time vnto euery deſire,</hi> that is to ſaye, there is a certaine ſet and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time by God, vnto the examining of all the wayes and manners of liuing, to try all the enterprizes and purpoſes of men,<note place="margin">There is a time with god for the redreſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities of this life.</note> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe and conſider euerie thing ſeuerally. <hi>And vpon euery worke there,</hi> that is to ſaye, there is no doubt a time to iudge &amp; examine euery worke in that ſame laſt iudgement, the which GOD
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:17735:110"/> hath appointed and ordeined for the redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the enormities of this life. And he doth ſignifie that ſame laſt iudgement by a liuely &amp; maruailous expreſſe keeping backe of ſome wordes, which figure they call <hi>apoſiopeſis.</hi> Hee teacheth therefore that there is puniſhment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by God the iudge both for lewdneſſe &amp; lewd perſons, and hee matcheth this life with the other and ſeconde life: that they ſhall not goe away ſcotfree. <hi>There,</hi> that is to ſay, in that iudgement to come, with that which here, that is in this life, they proudly and without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmente, ſinne and offende in. Therefore there is heere a double, contrarietie, both of time and place, the chaunge of both which hee ſayeth ſhall bee great, and therefore that in this knowledge of the iuſt iudgement of GOD there is a fit remedie againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of this life.</p>

But let vs rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a true demonſtration thereupon, of the laſt iudgement, which ſhalbe in his time: as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth, who ſayeth plainly, that theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, when as the godly are afflicted in this life, and the vngodly do triumph, are a proofe of the iuſt iudgement of God. For it muſt needes be that God is iuſt, otherwiſe he ſhoulde not bee God: for he cannot denye himſelfe. And howe I praye you in theſe confuſions, with the which this life for the moſt part is compaſſed about, can God haue his righteouſneſſe and iuſtice, or how can it appeare that he is iuſt? when as therfore iuſtice doth require that it ſhould go ill with the wicked, and well with the good (as the ſparkes left in our nature doe acknowledge) it foloweth neceſſarily, that God being both moſt iuſt and alwayes iuſt, hath appointed both a time and a place for the redreſſing of theſe confuſions, that there may be a full reſtoring of things confuſed and out of order. For it followeth not, that if nowe manie thinges be done diſordrouſly, that therefore they ſhalbe ſo in time to come. Now is the time of patience, the time to come ſhall bee a time of iudgement. In that the wicked doe nowe triumph voyde of all care, let vs beholde &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:17735:112"/> at the patience of God, but let vs in no caſe deny his iuſtice, the which no doubt ſhal appeare at his due and conuenient time. If nowe (ſayeth <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) manifeſt puniſhment ſhould correct euerie fault,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> nothing would be thought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued vnto that laſt day: therefore the laſt iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement is patiently to be waited for. Yet are not the teſtimonies of God his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed. Such as the Lorde will haue extant and to bee ſeene euen in this life. For hée hath not left himſelfe without witneſſe in the common vſe and courſe of life: And that ſame generall ſaying is true:<note place="margin">God hath his iudgements for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, euen in this life.</note> that hainous ſinnes are puniſhed with haynous puniſhmentes euen in this life. And truely, how many iudgements of God haue wee ſeene to light vppon the heads of thoſe men, who beeing armed with power and authoritie, haue broken iuſtice?<note place="margin">Few Tyrants dye without bloudſhed, or being mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.

But theſe no doubt are the beginnings of a greater, that is to ſaye, of a more perfect and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute iudgement: vppon the which we ought to ſet our mindes, and in the meane ſeaſon with
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17735:112"/> peace and ſilence waite for the fit and due time, which if hee prolong, hee will not prolong as the Prophet ſpeaketh. The godly and the vngodly ſhall not bee confounded and ſhufled vp togither, things ſhall not bee prepoſterouſly wrapped vp togither with a wandring errour of Fortune. God ſhall iudge the godly and vngodly: there hee ſhall put a difference betweene thoſe things, the which in this life are hudled together, he will at the appointed time bring into his true forme and faſhion this confuſed and diſordered heap of the things of this worlde. The wayting for then of the iudgement to come, ought to holde vp the mindes of the faithfull, that they faint not in the middeſt of the ſkirmiſhes: but hope for that day, which ſhall bring deliuerance and a full victorie vnto their labours: but vnto the vngodly a due recompence of their wickedneſſe.

I wil recite the more likely expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, out of the which I wil chooſe that which is more agreeable both vnto the wordes, and alſo the meaning, that is to ſaye, the which ſhall ſeeme moſt ſimple and moſt fit. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Some thinke that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh according vnto the iudgement of wicked and prophane men, that is according vnto the iudgement of man his reaſon falſly gathering. Others, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the ſame moſt lerned Interpreters ſuppoſe that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh not in their perſon, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the outward appearance of the verie things themſelues ſimply: foraſmuch as hee bringeth nothing, the which is vngodly, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth any way of vngodlines, nay the which is not agreeable vnto the Scripture, the which euery where with theſe arguments blameth &amp; increaſeth the vanitie of man: for that he doth
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:17735:113"/> not teach any thing, but only bring reaſons of doubting. Therefore they expound the whole place thus: <hi>That God hath made men cleare,</hi> that is to ſay, hath plainly opened and declared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, and hath ſhewed them, that they are vnto him as it were beaſtes: that is, that their eſtate doth neuer aw hit differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brute beaſtes: when as namely there is the ſame common end vnto them both, when as both of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently are ſubiect vnto death, liue with the ſame vitall ſpirit, haue the ſame vitall powers, the ſame functions of life, eating, drinking, ſleepe, generation, mouing, and other external and outward properties, are taken out of the ſame matter, namely out of the duſt, &amp; returne againe into duſt. And in the ende of their life, is there any that knoweth, whether the ſpirit of man goeth, and whether the ſpirite of a brute beaſt goeth, by what reaſons can he make dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene them? Thinges ſtanding in this order, in as much as the vanitie of man is ſo great, and that in outward ſhew and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance his condition differeth not from brute beaſts, that far the beſt kind of life is no other, then that ſo long as he remaineth aliue in this life, he vſe and enioy his labours ioyfully and quietly, and ſeaſon the ſweete pleaſure of the bodie with the ſounde vſe of the benefites of God, and with lawfull ioyfulneſſe of minde, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing things preſent pleaſant, and vtterly reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the care of things to come. I for my part
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17735:114"/> doe not diſallowe either of the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">A middle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</note> yet doeth the middle way like me better. For I cannot thinke that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply either in his owne perſon, or in the perſon of prophane men, as I ſuppoſe the learned, weighing the circumſtances of this place will iudge. Againe they doe not vnto the meaning of this place ſet down the ende of theſe words, the which no doubt is, the more to expreſſe the doubting of vanitie, the which falleth into the externall and outwarde conſideration of vertue. For if in this life lawe and right bee broken, and good and gyltleſſe men bee eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where moleſted and troubled verie ſore: yet at leaſtwiſe there ought to bee ſome difference in their death: yet the good man dyeth as wel as the badde. But that this may bee the more liuely ſet foorth (becauſe hee had ſpoken in an other place of the like ende of the good and badde) hee ſpeaketh generally of the ende of man, and compareth it with a brute beaſt, by the which compariſon the externall or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde condition of man is no doubt more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely vnderſtood.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I doe not agree with them in the expoſition of certaine wordes. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde theſe wordes <hi>Lebaram,</hi>

Againe, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of theſe woordes of one ſignification, ſhoulde bee nothing wiſely ſet downe: for the firſt is more than the latter, that is to ſaye, <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baram,</hi> than <hi>halireoth:</hi> and therefore it ſhoulde bee no increaſing but a leſſening: againe, the accent is againſt it: for it is a greater diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the accent which the Hebrewes do call <hi>Athnach,</hi> the which is diligently to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered vnto the finding out of the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">Theſe are gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mar mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore beyond the reach of the ſimple reader, and therefore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth vnto the learned, as doth that alſo which fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after.</note> and finally, what neede is there in this behalfe to heape vp wordes togither of one ſignification? Therefore I had rather haue an other ſenſe of thoſe wordes. For <hi>barar</hi> ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth not onelye to expreſſe or ſhewe a thing plainly, but alſo to chooſe and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17735:115"/> and ſure argumentes hath layde as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſight (for this is the ſignification of the Hebrewe verbe <hi>Raah</hi> in the coniugation <hi>Pihel</hi>) that men <hi>themſelues,</hi> men, I ſay, <hi>them verie ſelues</hi> (for the Pronoune is ſignificantly repeated) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with ſo greate giftes, <hi>are brute beastes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them ſelues,</hi> that is to ſaye, in reſpect of their owne eſtate, or of thoſe thinges which fall out vnto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen their owne conſcience, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience it ſelfe being witneſſes, or ſimply, <hi>he hath ſhewed them:</hi> ſo that they cannot pretende or colourably alleage any thing for excuſe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of their owne condition and eſtate, And this interpretation, as it is more agreeable vnto the wordes, ſo is it alſo vnto the meaning, and alſo containeth a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and excellent doctrine. For it is a plain compariſon, and the ſame contrarie, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon I ſaye betweene his firſte eſtate, in the which man was created, and that eſtate, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into he fell through his own fault, by reaſon of ſinne. For that ſame image of God, if it by it ſelfe had remained in man conſtantly without change, it had kept whole man from death, and had made him whole immortall. But death is the rewarde of ſinne:<note place="margin">A great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and brute beastes.</note> yet is there a great difference betweene man and brute beaſtes, the which were neuer indued with this image of GOD, for in man after the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of ſinne, there remaineth yet the image of GOD, but darkened with greate and

For this is the concluſion of that doctrine, which holdeth the ſoule to bee mortall: contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the concluſion of that doctrine which teacheth that the ſoule is immortall, is this, that abandoning the care of decking vp the bodye, wee ſhoulde frame oure liues accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto vertue and wiſedome. The wiſeman therefore diſputeth of the condition of our ſoule, according vnto the outwarde appearance of thinges, and according vnto the iudgement of man his reaſon: the which cannot fynde happineſſe in vertue it ſelfe ſo farre as may bee iudged of it by the effectes of life. For who iudging by the compaſſe of the reaſon of man, will iudge vertue to bee happie in the middeſt of tormentes, and in death it ſelfe?

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Haue regard vnto, or keepe]</hi> The tenoure of the matter in hande doeth altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that the beginning of the fifte chapiter bee taken from hence. For it is not onlye a newe argument, but alſo altogether a newe place, and in deede the moſt notable of all this whole Sermon, Concerning true felicitie or happineſſe. Meaning therefore to intreate of it, and to place it in the earneſt feare of God, that is in true godlineſſe, hee ſetteth downe a neceſſarye preface: and diligentlye teacheth, by what notes Godlineſſe ought to be ſet out, leaſt that in ſtead of true religion wee ſhoulde embrace a naked ſhadow and ſhew, and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing vizard of Religion.</p>
                  <p>This is the knitting and ioyning of this new matter with the wordes that went before, leaſt that with ſome interpreters wee ſhoulde thinke it to be a ſentence cutte off from the reſt, and yet that occaſion thereof was taken I knowe not vpon what wordes. This therefore is the meaning: I haue at large declared what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe is not, albeit that the reaſon of man doe imagine it to bee in diuerſe thinges and partes of the lyfe of man: I haue taughte with ſounde reaſons howe farre all thoſe idols and indeede but bare ſhewes ſundrye wayes inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by men, are from the truth, Nowe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17735:138"/> that I ſhewe wherein true happineſſe doth conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>This therefore is the frame of this diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe confutation hath ben at large hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the foure firſt chapiters. For as the truth cannot be well ynough, mayntayned, vnleſſe falſhoode bee ouerthrowne before, the whiche is manifolde and of ſundrie ſortes: ſo alſo in ouerthrowing of falſhoode farre longer trauell and ſpeech ought to be vſed.</p>
                  <p>The firſte lawe or rule of eſtabliſhing of godlyneſſe truelye and diligentlye is,<note place="margin">The firſt rule of true godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> that wee worſhip GOD in the congregation according vnto his word, that we refraine from mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions: that wee ſeeke for wholeſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in the Church and true miniſterie, and that we reuerently heare the Churche when it teacheth, ſtaye vppon her voyce, and doe not imbrace the inuentions of men: but that wee worſhip GOD with a pure and ſound minde, according vnto his word, the which is the rule of his will. For that it is great follye and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whatſoeuer men of their owne brayne in this behalfe inuent, and altogether vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable worſhip.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the worſhip of GOD are to be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>To take heede vnto our feete when as we goe vnto the houſe of God,</hi> is to worſhip god with a pure &amp;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17735:139"/> ſound mind, or, to carrie a pure &amp; ſound mind in worſhipping of god, in which kind of ſpeech the Apoſtle ſayth: <hi>Peripatein axios, Kai cuproſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dros euaggelio,</hi> that is to ſay, to lead our life as is meete and agreeable vnto the Goſpell. And this word <hi>Orthopodein</hi> alſo ſprang from thence, whiche ſignifyeth to walke with a right foote.

                  <p>In the meane ſeaſon by the ſame kinde of ſpeaking, hee playnely ſignifyeth wherein the worſhip of GOD doeth conſiſt, where whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome doctrine is to be ſoughte, and howe it is to bee receaued. For there is no doubt but that the Temple is ſignifyed by the naming of the Houſe of GOD: But becauſe the temple was as it were the ſumme of all Ceremonies, by the naming thereof, it is manifeſt that both the congregation of GOD, and wholeſome doctrine which ſhould ſounde in the Churche, and the true knowledge of GOD, is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode according vnto the vſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>When as therefore he willeth that the houſe of God bee gone vnto, hee willeth vs both to follow the worde of God, and to keepe oure ſelues in the boſom of the church, in the which onely is ſaluation: and therefore hee plainely
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17735:139"/> noteth the true worſhip of the true God. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as hee commaundeth that we take heede vnto our foote, hee commaundeth pureneſſe and ſoundneſſe of minde to be carefully vſed in the worſhip of God.<note place="margin">To take heed vnto our feete.</note> And this whole kinde of ſpeeche is taken from the cuſtome of the Law, for by the expreſſe commaundement of God, they wente not vnto the Temple but purifyed.

                  <p>There is namelye a notable ſaying of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell,</hi> vnto the whiche Solomon ſeemeth to haue alluded and had reſpecte: <hi>Is the Lorde delyghted and pleaſed with burnte offeringes and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, lyke as when a man heareth the voyce of the Lorde?

Wee doe fitly gather, that thoſe doe make ſhipwracke both of godlineſſe and honeſtie, the which doe contemne or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the worde of God: and therefore that they haue ſtayned themſelues with all kinde of wickedneſſe. The which argument is notably

And therefore when as he ſayeth, <hi>rather,</hi> his meaning is not to leaue it vnto our choyce, as if it were a certaine thing indifferent, and yet that the one is better than the other: but by this kinde of ſpeache borrowed from the common vſe of ſpeaking, and vſuall in the ſcripture, he meaneth, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſuperſtition in ſundrie ſhewes do pretende religion, and that men doe ſundry wayes dote vnder ſuch colours, yet that it is farre better to heare God, of whome the pure &amp; ſound trueth may be receiued.

Finally, like as when wee are carried away with vanitie, wee are ledde from ſaluation, and from the true

For it is a lantern vnto our feete for our whole life.

Raſhneſſe and haſtineſſe is the companion and waiting mayde of boldneſſe: much babling, of raſhnes.

I ſpeake of matters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining vnto God, of the which carnal men ſpeake both more boldly, and alſo more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than of thoſe the which are handled in the common vſe of life.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:17735:143"/> wee may appeare before his maieſty with quiet and aſſured mindes, and to ſpeake boldly with him as a father, that wee ſhoulde not in oure prayers make him a witnes either of prophane thoughts, or of fooliſh ſpeeche. And that in this place prayer is expreſſely noted, theſe wordes do ſhewe, <hi>Before God,</hi> to vtter a worde, or to thinke: for the ſcripture ſayeth that wee vtter before God thoſe things which wee aske of him: and he doth no leſſe heare the thinges which wee thinke, then which wee vtter with our mouth. For he is the ſearcher of the hart. <hi>Abraham</hi> being about to ſpeake before God,<note place="margin">Abraham.</note> craueth pardon at his hands to ſpeake, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth himſelfe to bee aſhes.

For this ſilence is to bee extended vnto our whole life. Doth God afflict or chaſtice vs, doth he toſſe his church vp and downe with great &amp; long troubles, doeth hee make it ſubiect vnto the luſtes of the wicked? Let vs lay out hand vpon our mouth, &amp; let vs not ſpeake euil of God his prouidence: let vs bridle our haſtines with this bit: <hi>If he ſlacke, he will not ſlacke.</hi> In the meane ſeaſon let vs with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence &amp; patience wait for the aide of the wiſe God both peculiarly for our ſelues, &amp; alſo for the whole church.

Nowe this alſo is to be obſerued, when as <hi>Solomon</hi> his meaning was by this law to eſtabliſh godlines, that he alſo preacheth vnto al men of the holie authoritie of the worde of God, namely that they heedefully heare the word of God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch nothing in the church, the which is not taught by him. Of this raſhnes &amp; boldnes are
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:17735:144"/> all other doctrines giltie, what ſhew of reaſon ſoeuer they do pretend. For they ſpeake raſhly before God, &amp; do ſwarue from the ſimplicitie of the word of God. It is therfore holy &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſilence to vtter thoſe things wiſely the which do appertaine vnto the doctrine of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For he doth not commaunde vs altogither to hold our peace, but he doeth forbid vs that we do not raſhly ſpeake any thing before God either with hart or mouth, that is to ſay. If a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the oracles of God. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man miniſter, let him miniſter as through the power which god giueth, that is, let him ſay nothing in the church, the which is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vnto faith, and rightly diuided, that is, not only true, &amp; aunſwerable vnto ſound doctrine, but alſo fit for the edifying of the church.

And hee maketh the vſe hereof two fold.<note place="margin">A twofold vſe of godlineſſe.</note> The firſt namelye, that oute of this true knowledge of God we ſhoulde fetche ſure and fit remedies againſt the cumberſome and troubleſom tentations the which are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ariſe in our mindes of the beholding of the affayres of men. This trouble and penſiueneſſe of minde doth hinder our happines, the which we cannot bee aſſured of among ſo ſundrie waues of doubting. The ſeconde vſe of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he teacheth to conſiſt in the waye to leade our life honeſtly: of the which hee giueth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne rules both generall and ſpeciall. And hee doth in ſuche ſorte intreate of them both that he doth both mingle the doctrine of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with his diſcourſe properlye concerning manners, and contrarily: namely ſo farre and in ſuch ſort as the fitneſſe of the proceſſe doth require. And this garniſhing and as it were po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of the matter was altogether needefull. For the feare of the Lorde mighte haue bene ſhewed in one word, as it were the mark wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at we ſhould aime and leuell: but becauſe the doctrine of godlineſſe, is not a vaine and idle contemplation or knowledge of the mind, but is altogether actiue, and conſiſteth in doing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually inſtructing euerye pointe of our life, therefore the vſe of it was to bee ſhewed moſte diligently and throughly: furthermore, whenas
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:17735:153"/> our mind is very greatly troubled with the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of thoſe outward things, &amp; that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great daunger: it was altogether requiſite, to make hereof a more long diſcourſe, that in ſo great confuſion or diſorder our mindes might haue whereon aſſuredly to reſt and ſtay. The Wiſeman therefore doth here begin a new matter. Hee hath deſcribed and ſette out the vanitie of mens affayres, from the whiche he hath taught by moſt ſtrong argumentes, that happineſſe is moſte farre. He hath ſhewed the diſeaſe, he was to teach the remedyes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now he excellentlye teacheth, howe oure minde may rid and vnwrap it ſelfe out of theſe temptations: and conſequently be at ſounde reſt. He beginneth with a moſt ſore and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous tentation</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>If thou ſeeſt,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A great ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> Of this tentation he had ſpoken in the thirde chap. ver. 16. &amp;c. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye howe it commeth to paſſe that in the place of iudgement and iuſtice, vngodlineſſe beareth rule, that is to ſaye, how law and righte is often broken by the Magiſtrate, the mayntayner of lawe and righte, vnder the coloure of law, how the guiltleſſe are ſore puniſhed by them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe protection and defence they oughte to bee ſafe from the iniuryes of lewde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. This temptation alſo greatly troubled Iob, Dauid, Ieremy. This hee firſt toucheth, If thou ſeeſt a poore man, whiche oughte to bee holpen with the help and ayde of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:17735:154"/> through the power of the more migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, or vnder the pretence and colour of lawe, (this he calleth <hi>Gezel miſchphat,</hi> that is, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away or breaking of lawe) to bee oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a countrye, and that by ſuche as beare the cheefe rule: Maruayle not at the will of God namelye, (for the Article ſette before it, ſheweth that by an excellencye a certayne ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and eſpeciall will is ſignifyed) that is, whether it ſeeme ſo good vnto GOD, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God regard theſe thinges, whether theſe thinges fall out by the prouidence and power of GOD. For it is an exception of man his reaſon: Doeſt thou thinke that God careth for the things of men, doth God ſee theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages and confuſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">An anſwere vnto a doubt of man his reaſon.</note>The reaſon therefore of man, doubteth of the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God becauſe of theſe hurly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burlies and troubles. Againſt this doubt <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſetteth downe an aunſwere: Queſtionleſſe (for I take this particle <hi>Ki,</hi> to be put more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expreſſe the ſence) hee that is on high, wardeth or watcheth ouer him that is on high, Marketh, beholdeth after the manner of a Watcheman, the thinges whiche are here done by men, in his due tyme, or hereafter meaning to puniſhe euerye thing, and, They that are on high are ouer them, that is to ſay, ouer the poore, and their ſubiectes, men of lower condition and degree: as if hee ſhould ſaye: In deede Princes and mightye men, the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:17735:154"/> whiche vſurpe a certaine infynite power and rule ouer men that are their inferiours, are no doubte higher than their ſubiectes: but God is higher than they. To what ende? That hee ſhoulde haue an ydle power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye? Not ſo: for hee is the Iudge of the Worlde: but that hee ſhoulde execute moſte ſharpe puniſhmente vppon thoſe whiche doe abuſe his authoritye, whome he marketh and noteth for this purpoſe. For his marking is not vayne or ydle. The Poet alſo hath noted this ſelfe ſame as it were courſe of manifold authoritye, Kinges that are to bee trembled at, haue a power ouer their owne Flockes, and Iupiter, that is to ſay GOD, hath power and rule ouer the Kings themſelues.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme is, that theſe outrages are not hidde from GOD, who as hee is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all thinges, ſo is hee lykewyſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernoure and Ruler of all thinges, as who by his prouidence, doeth both gouerne all the partes of the Worlde, and eſpeciallye watcheth ouer the affayres of men, and hath regard both of the godly and of the vngodly: and therefore that Tyrauntes, and Wronge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers ſhall not goe awaye ſcotte free, wyth that wherein they offende agaynſte the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſorte, when as they are to giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counte of their whole lyfe vnto GOD the cheefe Lorde and King. Hee therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth vs to Maruayle, namely in this reſpect,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:17735:155"/> that we ſhoulde not ſtande as it were at a bay, in this carefull and cumberſome cogitation, or doubte of the prouydence of GOD, the whiche doth ſo muche the more royallye and fully ſhine forth, for that it doeth wyſely order and diſpoſe things ſo intangled and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and conſtantly referre them vnto a verye good end. Furthermore this circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtaunce is to be weighed &amp; conſydered, <hi>That they that are on high,</hi> That is to ſaye: Kings and all Magiſtrates are <hi>ouer them:</hi> that is to ſaye, are in authorytye aboue the reſt. For it ſeemeth to be againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that when as al men are of one nature, and ſprung of one originall, and alike ſubiect vnto death, how it ſhoulde come to paſſe that they ſhould be ſeperated and ſeuered with ſo greate a difference within themſelues, and ſhould one ſo greatlye excell an other.<note place="margin">The wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God.</note> In this ſo greate inequalitie of men there ſeemeth to bee greate diſorder and confuſion: in the which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the wonderfull prouidence of GOD ſhineth forth, out of ſo ſundrye kindes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of men, gathering a wonderfull, harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and agreemente. The fellowſhip of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde coulde not ſtande: one coulde not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and beare an other, and therefore there ſhoulde raunge outrages of all lewdneſſe, vnles that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were held in as it were with the bridle of ſome greater autoritie and power. So there muſt needs be differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of ſuch as rule and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of ſuch as obey. For that ſtate, where there is
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:17735:155"/> no gouernour is the moſt certaine deſtruction and ouerthrow of mankind. God therefore preſerueth the ſocietie and fellowſhip of men by diſtinguiſhing and making difference of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in ſuperiours, and by laying neceſſitye on both partes, in the which fellowſhip things are ſo ordayned, that neyther can the ſupery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours be without the inferiours, nor the infery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours without the ſuperioures by any meanes. The which profit in the manifold good order of the ſociety and fellowſhip of men, he noteth in theſe wordes.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>And the profit of the earth,]</hi> I will ſpeake afterwards of the ſundrye Expoſitions of this place: I will firſte recite the ſimple and true meaning, as it ſeemeth vnto me.

And he ſayeth, <hi>In all thinges,</hi> to ſignifye the common fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of all men, which is manifolde by diſtincte diſtances as it were and ſeperations of degrees: ſo that the meaning is, In this difference of

This mutuall ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and neede that all men ſtand in one of an other, he ſheweth by a fine kinde of ſpeaking: <hi>The King ſerueth the Field.</hi> For it is an amply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and encreaſing of the matter in a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of things ſo vnlike.</p>

The ſumme is, that all men are tyed and knitte to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſo neceſſarye a bande, that euerye one euen of the ſuperiours doth ſtand in need of the ſeruice and helpe of the inferiours. For what? If Kinges and other mighty men ſhould til the earth, feed cattel, make garments, &amp; doe
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:17735:156"/> other ſuch like workes?

The firſt, that they ſhall giue an account of their life vnto GOD the cheefe Lord and Iudge, for that God doeth marke them to puniſhe them, according vnto their deſeruing. The ſeconde, that the prouidence of GOD ſhineth foorth in this confuſion, who euen by bad Magiſtrates doth preſerue the ſocietie of mankinde. Good Magiſtrates are indeede to bee wiſhed for (as he will ſaye hereafter) but it is better to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and beare a Tyraunt,<note place="margin">Better to haue a tyrant, then no gouernour at all.</note> then to haue no publique power at all, whereby men may be kepte in their duetye, for <hi>Anarchi,</hi> or that ſtate where there is no ruler, in ſteade of one Tyraunt, maketh and armeth manye, that is to ſay, ouerthroweth and deſtroyeth mankynde. What is then to bee done when as wee are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted or troubled by wicked Magiſtrates, We muſt not maruaile: that is to ſaye, wee muſt
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:17735:157"/> not denye the prouidence of God with angry and grudging mindes, but we muſte doe our duetye, and holde this ſurely, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhall be moſt ſeuerelye puniſhed for the forſaking and breaking of his office. In the meane ſeaſon, that God a wonderfull Worke-mayſter, in his good tyme will bring foorth lighte out of this darkeneſſe, that is to ſay, will preſerue the fellowſhip of men, and in it, the churche, euen by vngodlye Magiſtrates. This ſeemeth vnto me to bee the moſt ſimple and playne meaning of this place.<note place="margin">Other Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of this place. He alludeth vnto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, who doe feine that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraea the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice did firſt forſake the cities, and laſt of all the fieldes, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing there by that neyther citie, nor countrie was void of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and vn iust dealing, leauing no place at all for iustice to reſt in.</note> Others doe thinke that it is a commendation of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band man his lyfe, the whiche hee matcheth agaynſt other trades of liuing, in the whiche there is greate vanitye: but that the tilling of the earth is moſt profitable, wherevnto euen the King himſelf is compelled to ſerue. Which thinges truely I for my part, doe not ſee how they can agree with the things going nexte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, on the which theſe doe depend: nor how they can ſtand with the doctrine of this ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the which condemneth of vanitie all trades of liuing, that is to ſay, whatſoeuer is done vnder the Sunne. And howe quiet the countrie lyfe is, the poore Huſbandmen doe know, whom <hi>Astraea</hi> or <hi>Iustice</hi> doeth laſt of all viſit, leauing firſt the cities: yet in the ende ſhe flewe vp into heauen out of the fieldes.</p>

                  <p>I for my part, howſoeuer I thinke that theſe wordes generally may aptly bee ſpoken of the thinges, yet do I think them more ſimply to be expounded of man, in this ſence: whoſoeuer at length they were, the which haue bene in times before, and haue euery where obtayned greate famouſnes of name, or whoſoeuer they be that now are, doubtleſſe they were, or are nothing elſe but men. We need not go far for the proof of this matter: this is known vnto all men. And that it may be better perceiued what he woulde haue to be vnderſtoode by the word <hi>Man,</hi> that
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:17735:172"/> is to ſay, that man ſhould remember his eſtate, he addeth, <hi>And hee cannot ſtriue with him that is ſtronger then hee.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſaye: let men take heede with whome they haue to doe, and whether they can attempte any thing of their owne induſtrye and witte, they ſhall finde no doute that they haue to doe with God, whoſe Maieſtie doeth farre exceede their power and authoritie. When as they deſpiſe other men in regarde of themſelues, as being inferiour vnto them, let them call to remembraunce, that God is aboue them, with whome they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtriue, but that they muſt by &amp; by be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: for Death the Baylife of that moſte ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereigne Lord and King, ſhall make theſe luſtie gallants,<note place="margin">Death ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all men alike.</note> and ſuch as thinke themſelues ſhoaſed out from the common condition of men as it were, death I ſay ſhal make them equall with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, <hi>I haue ſayd</hi> (ſayth the Prophet) <hi>yee are Gods, and the ſonnes of the higheſt all of you, but yee ſhall die like men.</hi> And of purpoſe hee vſeth the worde <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby the common ſorte of men is ſignifyed, as namelye baſe and mortall. Thoſe famous Gyants therfore, and moſt ſtout perſons, are men: and as they were taken oute of the earth, ſo ſhal they returne vnto the earth agayne. The maieſtie of God being oppoſed or ſette agaynſte this miſerable baſeneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is of great force to beat down the pride of man his prudence.

The pageant of this life of ours is full of theſe chaunges, in the which thoſe which are more famous and of higher place, eſpecially, are many times examples of horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſerie: for of ſo manye millions of men, &amp; in ſo long ſpace of yeares,<note place="margin">Pompeius.</note>

It is more ſafe betimes to thinke on the vanitie of our life, and whereas we want wiſedome to fly vnto the prouidence of God, in the which no doubt we ſhall finde true firmeneſſe.

Therfore in the prouerbs calling men backe from the infamous luſte of adulterie, he teacheth that the wayes of a man are before the eyes of the Lorde, and ſpeaking of an adulterer, he ſayth that he feared not the Lord. For it is a blinde and profane boldneſſe, breaking the holy bands of faith and chaſtitie, to lie with a ſtraunge woman, or another man his wife. The wantonneſſe of men hath burſte out vnto ſo great lewdneſſe, that they ſcarce think fornication and adultery to be any great ſinne: and albeit that they being compelled through ſhame, and through the authoritye of the euerlaſting lawe of God haue made lawes agaynſt theſe ſinnes, yet thoſe lawes lie a ſleepe and are altogether ydle.

The which thing <hi>Solomon</hi> doeth flatly note: <hi>That a woman is more bitter then death it ſelfe:</hi> and that it is layd vpon ſinners by GOD, as a moſt grieuous plague, the which thing the examples of all both peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and times haue ſhewed: and <hi>Solomon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath had experience hereof by a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example both for himſelfe, and his, howe great calamities and miſeries thoſe immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate loues of women are wont to bring.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. and 28.

Therefore, where as <hi>Solomon</hi> in this place ſayeth that among a thouſande hee hath founde one good man, but neuer any where
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:17735:194"/> a good woman, it is to bee vnderſtoode by an exceſsiue ſpeache, or figure which the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricians call <hi>hyperbole,</hi> to the ende that the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries, which lye lurking vnder the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of women, might the better be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that they may be the more diligently auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

This thing ought to cauſe vs with al our hart to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the vnlawful loues of ſtraunge women. Moreouer, that we walke warily &amp; wiſely with

By the words of <hi>Turning about and ſeeing,</hi> he ſheweth that the ſame thing was confirmed by experience, the which he had diligently marked. <hi>That the race is not vnto the ſwift:</hi> Hee teacheth in expreſſe wordes, that the iſſues &amp; falling out of things are not in the hand, or induſtrie of man, no not in thoſe things the which appertaine vnto this life, as Ieremie ſayeth: I knowe Lord, that the way of man is not in man. Not as if a man were a blocke, and that there were no election or choyſe of will in them: (the whiche poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike men call the beginning of doing) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe GOD doeth bende the ſame purpoſe of the will of man, into what waye hee will, and doeth gouerne and diſpoſe the iſſues and fallinge out of thinges with an abſolute and chiefe rule and power.

For this is a principle knowen euen vnto the reaſon of man, That God will render vnto euery one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto his workes. But the good are thoſe in deede, whom God adopteth or choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in his ſonne, and vnto whome hee doeth impute or reckon the righteouſneſſe of his ſonne, and therefore doeth acknowledge them for his. And death is in deede the rewarde of ſinne: life euerlaſting, the gift of God. This iuſt iudgement of God ſhall no doubt redreſſe the diſorders the which fall out in this mortall life, and ſhal in the ende at his good time, pull out the hypocrits by the eares out of their lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hoales into the manifeſt light of his iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>So he hath here ſet downe the matter, &amp; the principall ende, &amp; principall circumſtances of this diſcourſe, namely, That happineſſe is not in any thinges of this worlde belonging vnto men. That it doeth conſiſt in the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true GOD: And that the ſame is the guyde and leader of our whole life, and doeth teache vs the true and certaine waye to
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:17735:239"/> frame our liues well and happily: that being furniſhed with fit remedies againſt all tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wee ſhoulde liue well, to the ende wee may dye well.</p>

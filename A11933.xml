            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

To conclude, that there appeareth no te≈øtimonye of his repentance, and that the renting a≈øunder of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which within ≈øhort time followed, doeth teache that God did in no wi≈øe forgiue vnto him this fault.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The minde of the Author touching the ≈øaluation of Solomon.</note>Doubtle≈ø≈øe the fault of <hi>Solomon</hi> was mo≈øt greeuous, and cannot by any meanes be excu≈øed.

            <p>The fall then of ≈øo excellente a per≈øonage,<note place="margin">To what ende the fal of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon is ≈øet forth vnto vs</note> is therefore ≈øet forth vnto vs, that we ≈øhould knowe with howe great care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈ø≈øe we ought to walke betweene the ≈øleightes of the Deuill and ≈øinne, in who≈øe ≈ønares the be≈øt men are ≈øomtimes entrapped: and moreouer that we holilye v≈øe the giftes of God, lea≈øt being puffed vp with them, we bee depriued of his grace, of the which being voyde, and tru≈øting vnto our ≈øtrength, we mu≈øt needes runne headlong into a≈ø≈øured de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction. Further the expre≈ø≈øe and plaine ≈øetting downe of the faulte of Solomon, appertayneth vnto the Hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye following of the ≈øcattering of the kingdome of I≈øra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, the cau≈øe whereof to haue re≈øted in the po≈øterity of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> is playnely proued by this notable ≈øinne of Solomon. But for all this, what≈øoeuer may bee determined eyther of the ≈øaluation or damnation of Solomon,<note place="margin">The fal of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon is no di≈øcredit to his writings, And why?</note> this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding mu≈øt be holden for certaintye, that the reproche of his falling awaye or puni≈øhment, maketh nothing at all agayn≈øte his Writinges, and that therefore the authority of them is not hereby le≈ø≈øened nor dimini≈øhed: For as muche as Solomon is not the Author, but onlye the Writer and interpreter of the truth in them conteyned and taughte, for the authoritie of doctrine mu≈øt not hang vpon the per≈øon of the mini≈øter, but altogether vpon the dignitye of the Author. And there is nothing, eyther in this or in the re≈øt of the writinges of Solomon, the which doeth not very well agree with the truth of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles, the which is all one and ≈øimple truth: as with one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øured con≈øent, the learned and right minded antiquity hath acknowledged: and the Hebrew copie it ≈øelfe numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the holye writinges doeth ≈øufficiently declare.</p>
            <p>Therefore I will not make anye longer ≈øtaye in the proofe of that matter, the whiche I ≈øet downe as ≈øure, and agreede vppon: namelye, that the writinges of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and al≈øo this Sermon, are Canonicall Scripture,
<pb facs="tcp:17735:7"/> and plainely agree with the truth, and that God would haue them remaine abroade for the edifying of his Ghurch. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye we are to begge of him that we may learn the pure and true meaning of this Sermon, and applye it vnto oure profite.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The cheefe and or ≈øcope of this di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe.</note>Hauing layde downe the authoritie of this Booke, the nexte is, that we ≈øee what is his ≈øcope, that is, his cheefe end, and what is the matter whereof it entreateth. They whiche haue in ≈øuche ≈øorte marked out this end, that they ≈øaye, that <hi>Solomon</hi> in ≈øetting forth the vanitie of this lyfe (that is to ≈øay of the councels and doinges of men) minded to make vs contented, and to be of quiet mindes in the common affairs and chaunces of this life, that we ≈øhould v≈øe with thanks gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the creatures of God, which through his ble≈ø≈øing are frankely giuen vnto vs, being contented with thinges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, without carefull pen≈øiuene≈ø≈øe for thinges to come: doe in deede ≈øay ≈øomething, but yet doe not plainely ynough ≈øet downe the matter: like as they doe not al≈øo who do thinke the principal point of this worke thus to be diuided: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that this whole ≈øermon is an auouching of doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God his prouidence, and a confuting of ≈øuch things as may be obiected again≈øt it, in the whiche are comfortes to ≈øtrengthen our mindes again≈øt the confu≈øion of thinges, and threatninges again≈øt tho≈øe vnbrideled outrages of men of lewd di≈øpo≈øition, which in this life run ra≈øhlye on on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head without all feare as it were of puni≈øhment. For the≈øe places are very excellently handled in this di≈øcour≈øe, yet are they not to be iudged the cheefe and principall ende of the ≈øame, but they are fitly applied for the proofe thereof. Now the rules of a true demon≈øtration doe require, that the thing it ≈øelfe be ≈øeuered from the circum≈øtances of the ≈øame. And as the thing or matter is one, ≈øo ought it to be noted oute with one certaine name, and not to be darkelye ≈øhadowed with a long di≈øcour≈øe of many words, lea≈øt that it bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the circum≈øtaunces of the ≈øame, the whiche were altogether di≈øagreeing from good order of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</p>
            <p>Therefore I take the principall ende of this di≈øcour≈øe to be, OF THE CHEEFE, or, SOVEREIGNE GOOD, the whiche by his contrary is notably declared.
<pb facs="tcp:17735:7"/> For when as Felicitie or happine≈ø≈øe is the principall and cheefe ende of oure whole life, and that all men with the whole labour and endeuour of their willes and ≈øtudies are caried therevnto, and becau≈øe in that common con≈øent and de≈øire of one and the ≈øame thing, there are ≈øo many and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers opinions of men of all ≈øortes, and yet in the mean ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon the greate≈øt part of men are led far and wide away from <hi>Felicitie or happine≈ø≈øe,</hi> it is altogether needefull that there ≈øhould be extant a plaine doctrine of Felicitie, wherevppon we might certainely re≈øt: lea≈øt in ≈øtead of true happine≈ø≈øe, we laye holde vpon the ≈øhew and ≈øhadow of happine≈ø≈øe. The which doubtle≈ø≈øe will come to pa≈ø≈øe, if we follow the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and leading of the wit of man, which with pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øiue, ra≈øh, and wandring error, ≈øeeketh felicitie in things of this world The which pen≈øiuene≈ø≈øe and errour of men, <hi>Solomon</hi> doeth here ≈øo artificially de≈øcribe and paint out, being a fit iudge of this controuer≈øie, that the heate and earne≈øtne≈ø≈øe of tho≈øe rea≈øoninges, and debating the matter cannot more liuelye be layd before vs. For fir≈øt he teacheth that happine≈ø≈øe is no where to be found in things of the world, <hi>viz.</hi> hee ≈øheweth, <hi>What happines is not,</hi> again≈øt the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts of man his rea≈øon, dreaming fal≈øly of a vaine ≈øhew of happine≈ø≈øe. Then hauing confuted the errours of this corrupte rea≈øon, hee teacheth <hi>What felicitie or happine≈ø≈øe is,</hi> and as he had parted and ≈øeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it from all the coun≈øailes and dealinges of the life of man: ≈øo hee doeth altogether place it in the feare of God, that is to ≈øay, in the true knowledge of the true God, and in his diligent and earne≈øt ≈øeruice: and finally he doeth diuer≈ølye and ≈øingulerlye declare the v≈øe of this knowledge. That this is the true ende, and handling of this whole di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe, the thinges being diligently weighed, I hope that all learned and ≈øober minded men will confe≈ø≈øe with mee, and that the ≈øame may fitly be diuided into three pointes. For fir≈øt the contrary member of this principall que≈øtion is ≈øet downe by the waye of confutation, namely, that <hi>true felicity is neuer to be found in any worldly matter, yea and that the title of happine≈ø≈øe is fal≈øly giuen vnto them,</hi> for as muche as in them there is no ≈øufficiencie or fulne≈ø≈øe, ≈øo that the minde maye be content with his owne e≈øtate, but mo≈øt great want of all thinges. Secondlye, the e≈øpeciall matter of this di≈øcour≈øe is
<pb facs="tcp:17735:8"/> ≈øhewed, and that expre≈øly, <hi>What true felicity or happines is,</hi> the which is wholy placed in godlines. And he teacheth that the ≈øame is not a vain &amp; idle contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, but indeed a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful &amp; effectual, the which goeth far &amp; wide, through the life of ours. Thirdly the v≈øe of this mo≈øt notable doctrine, is at large ≈øet forth, &amp; in di≈øcour≈øing thereof, throughout all the parts of man his life, a great part of this treati≈øe is occupied. For he diligently teacheth &amp; noteth a double force, &amp; as it were rea≈øon of this v≈øe. Fir≈øt that we ≈øhould ≈øtrengthen our minds with conuenient remedies again≈øt the want &amp; vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of fleeting and brittle things, that is, of ≈øuch things as are to be found in this mortall and mi≈øerable life, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we ≈øhould turne our ≈øelues from the vncertayne and cumber≈øome ≈øtate of the ≈øame, vnto thinges heauenly and euerla≈øting, and vnto that hope of re≈øtoring: and in the meane ≈øea≈øon a≈ø≈øure our ≈øelues that the prouidence of God will watche ouer our affayres, that tru≈øting vnto his ayde, hauing our mindes pacifyed, wee ≈øhould beare the toyles and laboures of this lyfe, and being contented with the pre≈øent ≈øtate of thinges, we ≈øhould v≈øe and enioye the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, and abandoning the de≈øyres of vayn thinges, wherevnto worldly men in vaine doe giue them≈øelues, wee ≈øhoulde ≈øeeke ≈øound ≈øufficiency and fulne≈ø≈øe of mind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the loue of this world, and among all the garboyles of the life of man, looke for vnto our ≈øelues an happy end.

            <p>All the≈øe thinges are plentifully and notably di≈øcour≈øed by Solomon, with a certaine and con≈øtant rowe of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the Obiections which ≈øeeme to be agayn≈øt this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine are diligentlye rehear≈øed, becau≈øe the≈øe prophane and worldly cogitations and thoughts do ≈øtir vp great &amp; dayly turmoiles in the mindes of men.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:17735:113"/> not teach any thing, but only bring rea≈øons of doubting. Therefore they expound the whole place thus: <hi>That God hath made men cleare,</hi> that is to ≈øay, hath plainly opened and declared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, and hath ≈øhewed them, that they are vnto him as it were bea≈øtes: that is, that their e≈øtate doth neuer aw hit differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> brute bea≈øtes: when as namely there is the ≈øame common end vnto them both, when as both of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently are ≈øubiect vnto death, liue with the ≈øame vitall ≈øpirit, haue the ≈øame vitall powers, the ≈øame functions of life, eating, drinking, ≈øleepe, generation, mouing, and other external and outward properties, are taken out of the ≈øame matter, namely out of the du≈øt, &amp; returne againe into du≈øt.

This is the ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne good of man: man, euen all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoeuer hee is, ought to direct all his ≈øtudie and thoughtes vnto this ende: or, if man bee anye thing, this onely hee is: all other thinges are vaine: all the accountes and doings of man ought to bee referred vnto this alone. So in Heathen writers, to <hi>Solon,</hi> and to <hi>Agathon,</hi> are taken for all one, namely for the principall &amp; chiefe ende, that man ought to haue regarde vnto, that is true happine≈ø≈øe. And for a rule of this godline≈ø≈øe, hee pre≈øcribeth and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: <hi>The commaundements of the Lorde,</hi> that is to ≈øaye, his word, the which was the third part of this di≈øputation, that the v≈øe of true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might bee ≈øhewed, for the right framing of our life, and the ≈øtrengthening of our mindes again≈øt the outrages and di≈øorders of the life of man, with the diligent and earne≈øt thinking vpon the prouidence of god, as he hath at large declared.

And death is in deede the rewarde of ≈øinne: life euerla≈øting, the gift of God.
